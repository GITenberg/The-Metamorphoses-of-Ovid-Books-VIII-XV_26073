<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">Minos</span> commences the war with the siege
of Megara. The preservation of the city depends on a lock of the hair of
its king, Nisus. His daughter, Scylla, falling in love with Minos, cuts
off the fatal lock, and gives it to him. Minos makes himself master of
the place; and, abhorring Scylla and the crime she has been guilty of,
he takes his departure. In despair, she throws herself into the sea, and
follows his fleet. Nisus, being transformed into a sea eagle, attacks
her in revenge, and she is changed into a bird called Ciris.</p>


<p>Now, Lucifer unveiling the day and dispelling the season of night,
the East wind<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_1" id = "tag8_1" href =
"#note8_1">1</a> fell, and the moist vapours arose. The favourable South
winds gave a passage to the sons of Æacus,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_2" id = "tag8_2" href = "#note8_2">2</a> and Cephalus returning;
with which, being prosperously impelled, they made the port they were
bound for, before it was expected.</p>

<p>In the meantime Minos is laying waste the Lelegeian coasts,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag8_3" id = "tag8_3" href = "#note8_3">3</a> and
previously tries the strength of his arms against the city Alcathoë,
which Nisus had; among whose honoured hoary hairs a lock, distinguished
by its purple colour, descended from the middle of his crown, the
safeguard of his powerful kingdom. The sixth horns of the rising Phœbe
were <i>now</i> growing again, and the fortune of the war was still in
suspense, and for a long time did victory hover between them both with
uncertain
<span class = "pagenum">264</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 13-47.</span>
wings. There was a regal tower built with vocal walls, on which the son
of Latona<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_4" id = "tag8_4" href =
"#note8_4">4</a> is reported to have laid his golden harp; <i>and</i>
its sound adhered to the stone. The daughter of Nisus was wont often to
go up thither, and to strike the resounding stones with a little pebble,
when it was a time of peace. She used, likewise, often to view the
fight, and the contests of the hardy warfare, from that tower. And now,
by the continuance of the hostilities, she had become acquainted with
both the names of the chiefs, their arms, their horses, their dresses,
and the Cydonean<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_5" id = "tag8_5" href =
"#note8_5">5</a> quivers.</p>

<p>Before the rest, she had observed the face of the chieftain, the son
of Europa; even better than was enough for merely knowing him. In her
opinion, Minos, whether it was that he had enclosed his head in a helm
crested with feathers, was beauteous in a helmet; or whether he had
taken up a shield shining with gold, it became him to assume that
shield. Drawing his arm back, did he hurl the slender javelin; the
maiden commended his skill, joined with strength. Did he bend the wide
bow with the arrow laid upon it; she used to swear that thus Phœbus
stood, when assuming his arrows. But when he exposed his face, by taking
off the brazen <i>helmet</i>, and, arrayed in purple, pressed the back
of a white horse, beauteous with embroidered housings, and guided his
foaming mouth; the virgin daughter of Nisus was hardly mistress of
herself, hardly able to control a sound mind. She used to call the
javelin happy which he touched, and the reins happy which he was
pressing with his hand. She had an impulse (were it only possible) to
direct her virgin footsteps through the hostile ranks; she had an
impulse to cast her body from the top of the towers into the Gnossian
camp, or to open the gates, strengthened with brass, to the enemy; or,
<i>indeed</i>, anything else, if Minos should wish it. And as she was
sitting, looking at the white tents of the Dictæan king, she said,
“I&nbsp;am in doubt whether I should rejoice, or whether I should
grieve, that this mournful war is carried on. I&nbsp;grieve that Minos
is the enemy of the person who loves him; but unless there had been a
war, would he have been known to me? yet, taking me for a
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 47-82.</span>
hostage, he might cease the war, and have me for his companion, me as a
pledge of peace. If, most beauteous of beings, she who bore thee, was
such as thou art thyself, with reason was the God <i>Jupiter</i>
inflamed with <i>love for</i> her. Oh! thrice happy were I, if, moving
upon wings through the air, I&nbsp;could light upon the camp of the
Gnossian king, and, owning myself and my flame, could ask him with what
dowry he could wish to be purchased; provided only, that he did not ask
the city of my father. For, perish rather the desired alliance, than
that I should prevail by treason; although the clemency of a merciful
conqueror has often made it of advantage to many, to be conquered. He
certainly carries on a just war for his slain son,<ins class =
"correction" title = "footnote tag missing"><a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_6" id = "tag8_6" href = "#note8_6">6</a></ins> and is strong both
in his cause, and in the arms that defend his cause.</p>

<p>“We shall be conquered, as I suppose. If this fate awaits this city,
why should his own arms, and not my love, open the walls to him? It will
be better for him to conquer without slaughter and delay, and the
expense of his own blood. How much, indeed, do I dread, Minos, lest any
one should unknowingly wound thy breast! for who is so hardened as to
dare, unless unknowingly, to direct his cruel lance against thee? The
design pleases me; and my determination is to deliver up my country as a
dowry, together with myself, and <i>so</i> to put an end to the war. But
to be willing, is too little; a&nbsp;guard watches the approaches, and
my father keeps the keys of the gates. Him alone, in my wretchedness, do
I dread; he alone obstructs my desires. Would that the Gods would grant
I might be without a father! Every one, indeed, is a God to himself.
Fortune is an enemy to idle prayers. Another woman, inflamed with a
passion so great, would long since have taken a pleasure in destroying
whatever stood in the way of her love. And why should any one be bolder
than myself? I&nbsp;could dare to go through flames, <i>and</i> amid
swords. But in this case there is no occasion for any flames or
<i>any</i> swords; I&nbsp;<i>only</i> want the lock of my father. That
purple lock is more precious to me than gold; it will make me happy, and
mistress of my own wish.”</p>

<p>As she is saying such things, the night draws on, the greatest nurse
of cares, and with the darkness her boldness
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 82-116.</span>
increases. The first slumbers are now come, in which sleep takes
possession of the breast wearied with the cares of the day. She silently
enters the chamber of her father, and (<i>O&nbsp;abominable</i> crime!)
the daughter despoils the father of his fatal lock, and having got the
prize of crime, carries with her the spoil of her impiety; and issuing
forth by the gate, she goes through the midst of the enemy, (so great is
her confidence in her deserts) to the king, whom, in astonishment, she
thus addresses: “’Twas love that urged the deed. I&nbsp;<i>am</i>
Scylla, the royal issue of Nisus; to thee do I deliver the fortunes of
my country and my own, <i>as well</i>; I&nbsp;ask for no reward, but
thyself. Take this purple lock, as a pledge of my love; and do not
consider that I am delivering to thee a lock of hair, but the life of my
father.” And <i>then</i>, in her right hand, she holds forth the
infamous present. Minos refuses it, <i>thus</i> held out; and shocked at
the thought of so unheard of a crime, he says, “May the Gods,
O&nbsp;thou reproach of our age, banish thee from their universe; and
may both earth and sea be denied to thee. At least, I&nbsp;will not
allow so great a monster to come into Crete, the birth-place of Jupiter,
which is my realm.” He <i>thus</i> spoke;<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_7" id = "tag8_7" href = "#note8_7">7</a> and when, <i>like</i> a
most just lawgiver, he had imposed conditions on the vanquished, he
ordered the <ins class = "correction" title = "variant spelling of ‘hawsers’">halsers</ins> of the fleet to be loosened, and the brazen
<i>beaked</i> ships to be impelled with the oars. Scylla, when she
beheld the launched ships sailing on the main, and <i>saw</i> that the
prince did not give her the <i>expected</i> reward of her wickedness,
having spent <i>all</i> her entreaties, fell into a violent rage, and
holding up her hands, with her hair dishevelled, in her frenzy she
exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Whither dost thou fly, the origin of thy achievements <i>thus</i>
left behind, O&nbsp;thou preferred before my country, preferred before
my father? Whither dost thou fly, barbarous <i>man</i>? whose victory is
both my crime and my merit. Has neither the gift presented to thee, nor
yet my passion, moved thee? nor yet <i>the fact</i> that all my hopes
were centred in thee alone? For whither shall I return, forsaken <i>by
thee</i>? To my country? Subdued, it is ruined. But suppose it were
<i>still</i> safe; by my treachery, it is shut against me. To the face
of my father, that I have placed in thy power. My fellow-citizens

hate me deservedly; the neighbours dread my example. I&nbsp;have closed
the whole world against me, that Crete alone might be open <i>to me</i>.

heifer, that begot thee. Nisus, my father, take vengeance upon me. Thou
city so lately betrayed, rejoice at my misfortunes; for I have deserved
them, I&nbsp;confess, and I am worthy to perish. Yet let some one of
those, whom I have impiously ruined, destroy me. Why dost thou, who hast
conquered by means of my crime, chastise that crime? This, which was

words, and thy ships, ungrateful man? Now, <i>ah!</i> now, it is not to

<p>Scarce has she said <i>this, when</i> she leaps into the waves, and
follows the ships, Cupid giving her strength, and she hangs, an
unwelcome companion, to the Gnossian ship. When her father beholds her,
(for now he is hovering in the air, and he has lately been made a sea
eagle, with tawny wings), he is going to tear her in pieces with his
crooked beak. Through fear she quits the stern; but the light air seems
to support her as she is falling, that she may not touch the sea. It is
feathers <i>that support her</i>. With feathers, being changed into a
bird, she is called Ciris;<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_11" id =

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Minos, having raised an army and received auxiliary troops from his
allies, made war upon the Athenians, to revenge the death of his son,
Androgeus. Having conquered Nisea, he laid siege to Megara, which was
betrayed by the perfidy of Scylla, the daughter of its king, Nisus.
Pausanias and other historians say that the story here related by the
Poet is based on fact; and that Scylla held a secret correspondence with
Minos during the siege of Megara, and, at length, introduced him into
the town, by opening the gates to him with the keys which she had stolen
from her father, while he was asleep. This is probably alluded to under
the allegorical description of the fatal lock of hair, though why it
should be depicted in that form especially, it is difficult to guess.
The change of Scylla into a lark, or partridge, and of her father into a
sea eagle, are poetical fictions based on the equivocal meanings of
their names, the one Greek and the other Hebrew; for the name ‘Ciris’
resembles the Greek verb <span class = "greek" title =
"keirô">κείρω</span>, which signifies ‘to clip,’ or ‘cut short.’
‘Nisus,’ too, resembles the Hebrew word ‘Netz,’ which means a bird
resembling the osprey, or sea eagle. Apollodorus says, that Minos
ordered Scylla to be thrown into the sea; and Zenodotus, that he caused
her to be hanged at the mainmast of his ship.</p>

<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">Minos</span>, having overcome the Athenians,
obliges them to pay a tribute of youths and virgins of the best
families, to be exposed to the Minotaur. The lot falls on Theseus, who,
by the assistance of Ariadne, kills the monster, escapes from the
labyrinth, which Dædalus made, and carries Ariadne to the island of
Naxos, where he abandons her. Bacchus wooes her, and, to immortalize her
name, he transforms the crown which he has given her into a
Constellation.</p>

<p>Minos paid, as a vow to Jupiter, the bodies of a hundred bulls, as
soon as, disembarking from his ships, he reached the land of the
Curetes; and his palace was decorated with the spoils there hung up. The
reproach of his family had <i>now</i> grown up, and the shameful
adultery of his mother was notorious, from the unnatural shape of the
two-formed monster. Minos resolves to remove the disgrace from his
abode, and to enclose it in a habitation of many divisions, and an abode
full of mazes. Dædalus, a&nbsp;man very famed for his skill in
architecture, plans the work, and confounds the marks <i>of
distinction</i>, and leads the eyes into mazy wanderings, by the
intricacy of its various passages. No otherwise than as the limpid
Mæander sports in the Phrygian fields, and flows backwards and forwards
with its varying course, and, meeting itself, beholds its waters that
are to follow, and fatigues its wandering current, now <i>pointing</i>
to its source, and now to the open sea. Just so, Dædalus fills
innumerable paths with windings; and scarcely can he himself return to
the entrance, so great are the intricacies of the place. After he has
shut up here the double figure of a bull and of a youth;<a class = "tag"

<p class = "explanation">
Oppressed with famine, and seeing the enemy at their gates, the
Athenians went to consult the oracle at Delphi; and were answered, that
to be delivered from their calamities, they must give satisfaction to
Minos. They immediately sent <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘ambasssadors’">ambassadors</ins> to him, humbly suing for peace,
which he granted them, on condition that each year, according to
Apollodorus and Diodorus Siculus, or every nine years, according to
Plutarch and Ovid, they should send him seven young men and as many
virgins. The severity of these conditions provoked the Athenians to
render Minos as odious as possible; whereupon, they promulgated the
story, that he destined the youths that were sent to him, to fight in
the Labyrinth against the Minotaur, which was the fruit of an intrigue
of his wife Pasiphaë with a white bull which Neptune had sent out of the
sea. They added, that Dædalus favoured this extraordinary passion of the
queen; and that Venus inspired Pasiphaë with it, to be revenged for
having been surprised with Mars by Apollo, her father. Plato, Plutarch,
and other writers acknowledge that these stories were invented from the
hatred which the Greeks bore to the king of Crete.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
As, however, these extravagant fables have generally some foundation in
fact, we are informed by Servius, Tzetzes, and Zenobius, that, in the
absence of Minos, Pasiphaë fell in love with a young noble of the Cretan
court, named Taurus, who, according to Plutarch, was the commander of
the fleet of Minos; that Dædalus, their confidant, allowed their
assignations to take place in his house, and that the queen was
afterwards
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 183-189.</span>
delivered of twins, of which the one resembled Minos, and the other
Taurus<ins class = "correction" title = ". invisible">. </ins>This,
according to those authors, was the foundation of the story as to the
fate for which the young Athenians were said to be destined.
Philochorus, quoted by Plutarch, says that Minos instituted funeral
games in honour of his son Androgeus, and that those who were vanquished
became the slaves of the conquerors. That author adds, that Taurus was
the first who won all the prizes in these games, and that he used the
unfortunate Athenians, who became his slaves, with great barbarity.
Aristotle tells us that the tribute was paid three times by the
Athenians, and that the lives of the captives were spent in the most
dreadful servitude.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Dædalus, on returning into Crete, built a labyrinth there, in which,
very probably, these games were celebrated. Palæphatus, however, says
that Theseus fought in a cavern, where the son of Taurus had been
confined. Plutarch and Catullus say, that Theseus voluntarily offered to
go to Crete with the other Athenians, while Diodorus Siculus says that
the lot fell on him to be of the number. His delivery by Ariadne,
through her giving him the thread, is probably a poetical method of
informing us that she gave her lover the plan of the labyrinth where he
was confined, that he might know its windings and the passage out.
Eustathius, indeed, says, that Ariadne received a thread from Dædalus;
but he must mean a plan of the labyrinth, which he himself had designed.
The story of Ariadne’s intercourse with Bacchus is most probably founded
on the fact, that on arriving at the Isle of Naxos, when she was
deserted by Theseus, she became the wife of a priest of Bacchus.</p>

<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">Dædalus</span>, weary of his exile, finds
means, by making himself wings, to escape out of Crete. His son Icarus,
forgetting the advice of his father, and flying too high, the Sun melts
his wings, and he perishes in the sea, which afterwards bore his name.
The sister of Dædalus commits her son Perdix to his care, for the
purpose of being educated. Dædalus, being jealous of the talent of his
nephew, throws him from a tower, with the intention of killing him; but
Minerva supports him in his fall, and transforms him into a
partridge.</p>


<p>In the meantime, Dædalus, abhorring Crete and his prolonged exile,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag8_16" id = "tag8_16" href = "#note8_16">16</a>
and inflamed by the love of his native soil, was enclosed <i>there</i>
by the sea. “Although Minos,” said he, “may beset the land and the sea,
still the skies, at least, are open. By that way will we go: let Minos
possess everything <i>besides</i>: he does not sway the air.”

thread, and the lowermost ones with wax; and, thus ranged, with a gentle
curvature, he bends them, so as to imitate real <i>wings of</i> birds.
His son Icarus stands together with him; and, ignorant that he is
handling <i>the source of</i> danger to himself, with a smiling
countenance, he sometimes catches at the feathers which the shifting
breeze is ruffling; and, at other times, he softens the yellow wax with
his thumb; and, by his playfulness, he retards the wondrous work of his
father.</p>

<p>After the finishing hand was put to the work, the workman himself
poised his own body upon the two wings, and hung suspended in the beaten
air. He provided his son <i>with them</i> as well; and said to him,
“Icarus, I&nbsp;recommend thee to keep the middle tract; lest, if thou
shouldst go too low, the water should clog thy wings; if too high, the
fire <i>of the sun</i> should scorch them. Fly between both; and I bid
thee neither to look at Boötes, nor Helice,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_17" id = "tag8_17" href = "#note8_17">17</a> nor the drawn sword
of Orion. Under my guidance, take thy way.” At the same time, he
delivered him rules for flying, and fitted the untried wings to his
shoulders. Amid his work and his admonitions, the cheeks of the old man
were wet, and the hands of the father trembled. He gives kisses to his
son, never again to be repeated; and, raised upon his wings, he flies
before, and is concerned for his companion, just as the bird which has
led forth her tender young from the lofty nest into the air. And he
encourages him to follow, and instructs him in the fatal art, and both
moves his own wings himself, and looks back on those of his son.
A&nbsp;person while he is angling for fish with his quivering rod, or
the shepherd leaning on his crook, or the ploughman on the plough tail,
when he beholds them, is astonished, and believes them to be Divinities,
who thus can cleave the air. And now Samos,<a class = "tag" name =

began to be pleased with a bolder flight, and forsook his guide; and,
touched with a desire of reaching heaven, pursued his course still
higher. The vicinity of the scorching Sun softened the fragrant wax that
fastened his wings. The wax was melted; he shook his naked arms, and,
wanting his oar-like wings, he caught no <i>more</i> air. His face, too,
as he called on the name of his father, was received in the azure water,
which received its name<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_21" id = "tag8_21"
href = "#note8_21">21</a> from him.</p>

<p>But the unhappy father, now no more a father, said, “Icarus, where
art thou? In what spot shall I seek thee, Icarus?” did he say;
<i>when</i> he beheld his wings in the waters, and <i>then</i> he cursed
his own arts; and he buried his body in a tomb, and the land was called
from the name of him buried there. As he was laying the body of his
unfortunate son in the tomb, a&nbsp;prattling partridge beheld him from
a branching holm-oak,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_22" id = "tag8_22"
href = "#note8_22">22</a> and, by its notes, testified its delight.
’Twas then but a single bird <i>of its kind</i>, and never seen in
former years, and, lately made a bird, was a grievous reproof, Dædalus,
to thee. For, ignorant <i>of the decrees</i> of fate, his sister had
entrusted her son to be instructed by him, a&nbsp;boy who had passed
twice six birthdays, with a mind eager for instruction. ’Twas he, too,
who took the backbones observed in the middle of the fish, for an
example, and cut <i>a</i> continued <i>row of</i> teeth in iron, with a
sharp edge, and <i>thus</i> discovered the use of the saw.</p>

<p>He was the first, too, that bound two arms of iron to one centre,
that, being divided <i>and</i> of equal length, the one part might stand
fixed, <i>and</i> the other might describe a circle. Dædalus was
envious, and threw him headlong from the sacred citadel of Minerva,
falsely pretending that he had fallen <i>by accident</i>. But Pallas,
who favours ingenuity, received him, and made him a bird; and, in the
middle of the air, he flew upon
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 254-261.</span>
wings. Yet the vigour of his genius, once so active, passed into his
wings and into his feet; his name, too, remained the same as before. Yet
this bird does not raise its body aloft, nor make its nest in the
branches and the lofty tops <i>of trees, but</i> flies near the ground,
and lays its eggs in hedges: and, mindful of its former fall, it dreads
the higher regions.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Dædalus was a talented Athenian, of the family of Erechtheus; and he was
particularly famed for his skill in statuary and architecture. He became
jealous of the talents of his nephew, Talos, whom Ovid here calls
Perdix; and, envying his inventions of the saw, the compasses, and the
art of turning, he killed him privately. Flying to Crete, he was
favourably received by Minos, who was then at war with the Athenians. He
there built the Labyrinth, as Pliny the Elder asserts, after the plan of
that in Egypt, which is described by Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and
Strabo. Philochorus, however, as quoted by Plutarch, says that it did
not resemble the Labyrinth of Egypt, and that it was only a prison in
which criminals were confined.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Minos, being informed that Dædalus had assisted Pasiphaë in carrying out
her criminal designs, kept him in prison; but escaping thence, by the
aid of Pasiphaë, he embarked in a ship which she had prepared for him.
Using sails, which till then, according to Pausanias and Palæphatus,
were unknown, he escaped from the galleys of Minos, which were provided
with oars only. Icarus, either fell into the sea, or, overpowered with
the fatigues of the voyage, died near an island in the Archipelago,
which afterwards received his name. These facts have been disguised by
the poets under the ingenious fiction of the wings, and the neglect of
Icarus to follow his father’s advice, as here related.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Diana</span>, offended at the neglect of
Œneus, king of Calydon, when performing his vows to the Gods, sends a
wild boar to ravage his dominions; on which Œneus assembled the princes
of the country for its pursuit. His son Meleager leads the chase, and,
having killed the monster, presents its head to his mistress, Atalanta,
the daughter of the king of Arcadia. He afterwards kills his two uncles,
Plexippus and Toxeus, who would deprive her of this badge of his
victory. Their sister Althæa, the mother of Meleager, filled with grief
at their death, loads her son with execrations; and, remembering the
torch which she received from the Fates at his birth, and on which the
preservation of his life depends, she throws it into the fire. As soon
as it is consumed, Meleager expires in the greatest torments. His
sisters mourn over his body, until Diana changes them into birds.</p>

for his kindness. <i>And</i> now Athens has ceased to pay her mournful
tribute, through the exploits of Theseus. The temples are decked with
garlands, and they invoke warlike Minerva, with Jupiter and the other
Gods, whom they adore with the blood <i>of victims</i> vowed, and with
presents offered, and censers<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_24" id =

spread the renown of Theseus throughout the Argive cities, and the
nations which rich Achaia contained, implored his aid amid great
dangers. Calydon, <i>too</i>, although it had Meleager,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8_25" id = "tag8_25" href = "#note8_25">25</a> suppliantly
addressed him with anxious entreaties. The occasion of asking <i>aid</i>
was a boar, the servant and the avenger of Diana in her wrath.</p>

<p>For they say that Œneus, for the blessings of a plenteous year, had
offered the first fruits of the corn to Ceres, to Bacchus his wine, and
the Palladian juice<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_26" id = "tag8_26" href

These invidious honours commencing with the rural <i>Deities</i>, were
continued to all the Gods above; they say that the altars of the
daughter of Latona, who was omitted, were alone left without
frankincense. Wrath affects even the Deities. “But <i>this</i>,” says
she, “I&nbsp;will not tamely put up with; and I, who am thus
dishonoured, will not be said to be unrevenged <i>as well</i>:” and she

mouth; the foliage is burnt up with the blast. One while he tramples
down the corn in the growing blade, and crops the expectations of the
husbandman, doomed to lament, as yet unripe, and he intercepts the corn
in the ear. In vain does the threshing floor, and in vain do the barns
await the promised harvest. The heavy grapes, with the long branches of
the vine, are scattered about, and the berries with the boughs of the
ever-green olive. He vents his fury, too, upon the flocks. These,
neither dogs nor shepherds <i>can protect</i>; not <i>even</i> the
fierce bulls are able to defend the herds. The people fly in all
directions, and do not consider themselves safe, but in the walls of a

reason, was that of a maid in a boy, that of a boy in a maid. Her the
Calydonian hero both beheld, and at the same moment sighed for her,
against the will of the God; and he caught the latent flame, and said,
“Oh, happy <i>will he be</i>, if she shall vouchsafe <i>to make</i> any

<p>A wood, thick with trees, which no age has cut down, rises from a
plain, and looks down upon the fields below. After the heroes are come
there, some extend the nets; some take the couples off the dogs, some
follow close the traces of his feet, and are anxious to discover their
own danger. There is a hollow channel, along which rivulets of rain
water are wont to discharge themselves. The bending willows cover the
lower parts of the cavity, and smooth sedges, and marshy rushes, and
oziers, and thin reeds with their long stalks. Aroused from this spot,
the boar rushes violently into the midst of the enemy, like lightning
darted from the bursting clouds. In his onset the grove is laid level,
and the wood, borne down, makes a crashing noise. The young men raise a
shout, and with strong right hands hold their weapons extended before
them, brandished with their broad points<ins class = "correction" title
= ", for .">. </ins>Onward he rushes, and disperses the dogs, as any one
<i>of them</i> opposes his career; and scatters them, as they bark <i>at
him</i>, with sidelong wounds. The spear that was first hurled by the
arm of Echion, was unavailing, and made a slight incision in the trunk
of a maple tree. The next, if it had not employed too much of the
strength of him who threw it, seemed as if it would stick in the back it
was aimed at: it went beyond. The owner of the weapon was the Pagasæan
Jason. “Phœbus,” said the son of Ampycus,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_60" id = "tag8_60" href = "#note8_60">60</a> “if I have worshipped
thee, and if I do worship thee, grant me <i>the favour</i> to reach what
is <i>now</i> aimed at, with unerring weapon.” The God consented to his
prayer, so far as he could. The boar was struck by him, but without a
wound; Diana took the steel head from off the flying weapon; the shaft
reached him without the point. The rage of the monster was aroused, and
not less violently was he inflamed than the lightnings; light darted
from his eyes, and flame was breathed from his breast. As the stone
flies, launched by the tightened rope, when it is aimed<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8_61" id = "tag8_61" href = "#note8_61">61</a> at either
walls, or towers filled with soldiers, with the like unerring onset is
the destroying boar borne on among the youths, and lays upon the ground
Eupalamus and Pelagon,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_62" id = "tag8_62"
href = "#note8_62">62</a> who guard the right wing. <i>Thus</i>
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 361-391.</span>
prostrate, their companions bear them off. But Enæsimus, the son of
Hippocoön, does not escape a deadly wound. The sinews of his knee, cut
<i>by the boar</i>, fail him as he trembles, and prepares to turn his
back.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, the Pylian <i>Nestor</i> would have perished<a class =
"tag" name = "tag8_63" id = "tag8_63" href = "#note8_63">63</a> before
the times of the Trojan <i>war</i>: but taking a spring, by means of his
lance, planted <i>in the ground</i>, he leaped into the branches of a
tree that was standing close by, and, safe in his position, looked down
upon the enemy which he had escaped. He, having whetted his tusk on the
trunk of an oak, fiercely stood, ready for their destruction; and,
trusting to his weapons newly pointed, gored the thigh of the great
Othriades<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_64" id = "tag8_64" href =
"#note8_64">64</a> with his crooked tusks. But the two brothers, not yet
made Constellations of the heavens, distinguished from the rest, were
borne upon horses whiter than the bleached snow; <i>and</i> both were
brandishing the points of their lances, poised in the air, with a
tremulous motion. They would have inflicted wounds, had not the bristly
<i>monster</i> entered the shady wood, a&nbsp;place penetrable by
neither weapons nor horses. Telamon pursues him; and, heedless in the
heat of pursuit, falls headlong, tripped up by the root of a tree. While
Peleus<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_65" id = "tag8_65" href =
"#note8_65">65</a> is lifting him up, the Tegeæan damsel fits a swift
arrow to the string, and, bending the bow, lets it fly. Fixed under the
ear of the beast, the arrow razes the surface of the skin, and dyes the
bristles red with a little blood. And not more joyful is she at the
success of her aim than Meleager&nbsp;is.</p>

<p>He is supposed to have observed it first, and first to have pointed
out the blood to his companions, and to have said, “Thou shalt receive
due honour for thy bravery.” The heroes blush <i>in emulation</i>; and
they encourage one another, and raise their spirits with shouts, and
discharge their weapons without any order. Their <i>very</i> multitude
is a hindrance to those that are thrown, and it baffles the blow for
which it is designed. Behold! the Arcadian,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_66" id = "tag8_66" href = "#note8_66">66</a> wielding his
battle-axe, rushing madly
<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 391-430.</span>
on to his fate, said, “Learn, O&nbsp;youths, how much the weapons of men
excel those of women, and give way for my achievement. Though the
daughter of Latona herself should protect him by her own arms, still, in
spite of Diana, shall my right hand destroy him.” Such words did he
boastingly utter with self-confident lips; and lifting his double-edged
axe with both hands, he stood erect upon tiptoe. The beast seized him
<i>thus</i> bold, and, where there is the nearest way to death, directed
his two tusks to the upper part of his groin. Ancæus fell; and his
bowels, twisted, rush forth, falling with plenteous blood, and the earth
was soaked with gore. Pirithoüs, the son of Ixion, was advancing
straight against the enemy, shaking his spear in his powerful right
hand. To him the son of Ægeus, at a distance, said, “O&nbsp;thou, dearer
to me than myself; stop, thou better part of my soul; we may be valiant
at a distance: his rash courage was the destruction of Ancæus.”
<i>Thus</i> he spoke, and he hurled his lance of cornel wood, heavy with
its brazen point; which, well poised, and likely to fulfil his desires,
a&nbsp;leafy branch of a beech-tree opposed.</p>

<p>The son of Æson, too, hurled his javelin, which <i>unlucky</i> chance
turned away from <i>the beast</i>, to the destruction of an unoffending
dog, and running through his entrails, it was pinned through
<i>those</i> entrails into the earth. But the hand of the son of Œneus
has different success; and of two discharged by him, the first spear is
fastened in the earth, the second in the middle of his back. There is no
delay; while he rages, while he is wheeling his body round, and pouring
forth foam, hissing with the fresh blood, the giver of the wound comes
up, and provokes his adversary to fury, and buries his shining hunting
spear in his opposite shoulder. His companions attest their delight in
an encouraging shout, and in their right hands endeavour to grasp the
conquering right hand; and with wonder they behold the huge beast as he
lies upon a large space of ground, and they do not deem it safe as yet
to touch him; but yet they, each of them, stain their weapons with his
blood. <i>Jason</i> himself, placing his foot upon it, presses his
frightful head, and thus he says: “Receive, Nonacrian Nymph, the spoil
that is my right; and let my glory be shared by thee.” Immediately he
gives her the skin as the spoil, thick with the stiffening bristles, and
the head remarkable for the huge tusks. The giver of the present, as
well as the present, is a <i>source</i> of pleasure to
<span class = "pagenum">282</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 430-463.</span>
her. The others envy her, and there is a murmuring throughout the whole
company. Of these, stretching out their arms, with a loud voice, the
sons of Thestius cry out, “Come, lay them down, and do not thou,
a&nbsp;woman, interfere with our honours; let not thy confidence in thy
beauty deceive thee, and let the donor, seized with this passion for
thee, keep at a distance.” And <i>then</i> from her they take the
present, <i>and</i> from him the right <i>of disposing</i> of the
present.</p>

<p>The warlike<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_67" id = "tag8_67" href =
"#note8_67">67</a> <i>prince</i> did not brook it, and, indignant with
swelling rage, he said, “Learn, ye spoilers of the honour that belongs
to another, how much deeds differ from threats;” and, with his cruel
sword, he pierced the breast of Plexippus, dreading no such thing. Nor
suffered he Toxeus, who was doubtful what to do, and both wishful to
avenge his brother, and fearing his brother’s fate, long to be in doubt;
but a second time warmed his weapon, reeking with the former slaughter,
in the blood of the brother.</p>

<p>Althæa was carrying gifts to the temples of the Gods, her son being
victorious, when she beheld her slain brothers carried off <i>from the
field</i>: uttering a shriek, she filled the city with her sad
lamentations, and assumed black garments in exchange for her golden
ones. But soon as the author of their death was made known, all grief
vanished; and from tears it was turned to a thirst for vengeance. There
was a billet, which, when the daughter of Thestius was lying in labour
<i>with her son</i>, the three Sisters, <i>the Fates</i>, placed in the
flames, and spinning the fatal threads, with their thumbs pressed upon
them, they said, “We give to thee, O&nbsp;new-born <i>babe</i>, and to
this wood, the same period <i>of existence</i>.” Having uttered this
charm, the Goddesses departed; <i>and</i> the mother snatched the
flaming brand from the fire, and sprinkled it with flowing water. Long
had it been concealed in her most retired apartment; and being
<i>thus</i> preserved, had preserved, O&nbsp;youth, thy life. This
<i>billet</i> the mother <i>now</i> brings forth, and orders torches to
be heaped on broken pieces <i>of wood</i>; and when heaped, applies to
them the hostile flames. Then four times essaying to lay the branch upon
the flames, four times does she pause in the attempt. Both the mother
<span class = "pagenum">283</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 463-492.</span>
and the sister struggle hard, and the two different titles influence her
breast in different ways. Often is her countenance pale with
apprehension of the impending crime; often does rage, glowing in her
eyes, produce its red colour. And one while is her countenance like that
of one making some cruel threat or other; at another moment, such as you
could suppose to be full of compassion. And when the fierce heat of her
feelings has dried up her tears, still are tears found <i>to flow</i>.
Just as the ship, which the wind and a tide running contrary to the
wind, seize, is sensible of the double assault, and unsteadily obeys
them both; no otherwise does the daughter of Thestius fluctuate between
<i>two</i> varying affections, and in turn lays by her anger, and rouses
it again, <i>when thus</i> laid by. Still, the sister begins to get the
better of the parent; and that, with blood she may appease the shades of
her relations, in her unnatural conduct she proves affectionate.</p>

<p>For after the pernicious flames gained strength, she said, “Let this
funeral pile consume my entrails.” And as she was holding the fatal
billet in her ruthless hand, she stood, in her wretchedness, before the
sepulchral altars,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_68" id = "tag8_68" href

both avenging and am committing a crime. With death must death be
expiated; crime must be added to crime, funeral to funeral; by
accumulated calamities, let this unnatural race perish. Shall Œneus, in
happiness, be blessed in his victorious son; and shall Thestius be
childless? It is better that you both should mourn. Only do ye, ghosts

purpose, I&nbsp;confess that he deserves to die; but the author of his
death is repugnant to me. Shall he then go unpunished? Alive and
victorious, and flushed with his success, shall he possess the realms of
Calydon? <i>And</i> shall you lie, a&nbsp;little heap of ashes, and
<i>as</i> lifeless phantoms? For my part, I&nbsp;will not endure this.
Let the guilty wretch perish, and let him carry along with him the hopes
of his father,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_71" id = "tag8_71" href =
"#note8_71">71</a> and the ruin of his kingdom and country. <i>But</i>
where are the feelings of a mother, where are the affectionate ties of
the parent? Where, too, are the pangs which for twice five months<a
class = "tag" name = "tag8_72" id = "tag8_72" href = "#note8_72">72</a>
I&nbsp;have endured? Oh, that thou hadst been burnt, when an infant, in
that first fire! And would that I had allowed it! By my aid hast thou
lived; now, for thy own deserts, shalt thou die. Take the reward of thy
deeds; and return to me that life which was twice given thee, first at
thy birth, next when the billet was rescued; or else place me as well in
the tomb of my brothers. I&nbsp;both desire <i>to do it</i>, and I am
unable. What shall I do? one while the wounds of my brothers are before
my eyes, and the form of a murder so dreadful; at another time,
affection and the name of mother break my resolution. Wretch that I am!
To my sorrow, brothers, will you prevail; but <i>still</i> prevail; so
long as I myself shall follow the appeasing sacrifice that I shall give
you, and you yourselves;” she <i>thus</i> said, and turning herself
away, with trembling right hand she threw the fatal brand into the midst
of the flames.</p>

<p>That billet either utters, or seems to utter, a&nbsp;groan, and,
caught by the reluctant flames, it is consumed. Unsuspecting, and at a
distance, Meleager is burned by that flame, and feels his entrails
scorched by the secret fires; but with fortitude he supports the mighty
pain. Still, he grieves that he dies by an inglorious death, and without
<i>shedding his</i> blood, and says that the wounds of Ancæus were a
happy lot. And while, with a sigh, he calls upon his aged father, and
his brother, and his affectionate sisters, and with his last words the
companion of his bed,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_73" id = "tag8_73"

diminish. Both of them are extinguished together, and by degrees his
spirit vanishes into the light air.</p>

people and nobles lament; and the Calydonian matrons of Evenus,<a class

tearing their hair, bewail him. Lying along upon the ground, his father

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
It is generally supposed that the story of the chase of the Calydonian
boar, though embracing much of the fabulous, is still based upon
historical facts. Homer, in the 9th book of the Iliad, alludes to it,
though in somewhat
<span class = "pagenum">286</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 546-558.</span>
different terms from the account here given by Ovid; and from the
ancient historians we learn, that Œneus, offering the first fruits to
the Gods, forgot Diana in his sacrifices. A&nbsp;wild boar, the same
year having ravaged some part of his dominions, and particularly a
vineyard, on the cultivation of which he had bestowed much pains, these
circumstances, combined, gave occasion for saying that the boar had been
sent by Diana. As the wild beast had killed some country people,
Meleager collected the neighbouring nobles, for the purpose of
destroying it. Plexippus and Toxeus, having been killed, in the manner
mentioned by the Poet, Althæa, their sister, in her grief, devoted her
son to the Furies; and, perhaps, having used some magical incantations,
the story of the fatal billet was invented.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Homer does not mention the death of Meleager; but, on the contrary, says
that his mother, Althæa, was pacified. Some writers, however, think that
he really was poisoned by his mother. The story of the change of the
sisters of Meleager into birds is only the common poetical fiction,
denoting the extent of their grief at the untimely death of their
brother.</p>

Naiads, who had been changed into the islands called Echinades, and an
account of his own amour with the Nymph Perimele, whom, being thrown by
her father into the sea, Neptune had transformed into an island.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Theseus having performed his part in the joint
labour, was going to the Erecthean towers of Tritonis. <i>But</i>
Acheloüs, swollen with rains, opposed his journey,<a class = "tag" name

high folds, contiguous to my banks, swept away, together with the
flocks; nor was it of any avail there for the herd to be strong, nor for
the horses to be swift. Many bodies, too, of young men has this torrent
overwhelmed in its whirling eddies, when the snows of the mountains
dissolved. Rest is the safer <i>for thee</i>; until the river runs
within its usual bounds, until its own channel receives the flowing
waters.”</p>
<span class = "pagenum">287</span>

<p>To <i>this</i> the son of Ægeus agreed; and replied, “I&nbsp;will
make use of thy dwelling and of thy advice, Acheloüs;” and both he did
make use of. He entered an abode built of pumice stone with its many
holes, and the sand-stone far from smooth. The floor was moist with soft
moss, shells with alternate <i>rows of</i> murex arched the roof. And
now, Hyperion having measured out two parts of the light, Theseus and
the companions of his labours lay down upon couches; on the one side the
son of Ixion,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_79" id = "tag8_79" href =

temples now covered with thin grey hairs; and some others whom the river
of the Acarnanians, overjoyed with a guest so great, had graced with the
like honour. Immediately, some Nymphs, barefoot, furnished with the
banquet the tables that were set before them; and the dainties being
removed, they served up wine in <i>bowls adorned with</i> gems. Then the
mighty hero, surveying the seas that lay beneath his eyes, said, “What
place is this?” and he pointed with his finger; “and inform me what name
that island bears; although it does not seem to be one only?” In answer
to these words, the River said, “It is not, indeed, one object that we
see; five countries lie <i>there</i>; they deceive through their
distance. And that thou mayst be the less surprised at the deeds of the
despised Diana, these were Naiads; who, when they had slain twice five
bullocks, and had invited the Gods of the country to a sacrifice, kept a
joyous festival, regardless of me. <i>At this</i> I swelled, and I was
as great as I ever am, in my course, when I am the fullest; and,
redoubled both in rage and in flood, I&nbsp;tore away woods from woods,
and fields from fields; and together with the spot, I&nbsp;hurled the
Nymphs<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_80" id = "tag8_80" href =

of the name of a virgin. This her father, Hippodamas, took amiss, and
pushed the body of his daughter, when about to bring forth, from a rock,
into the sea. I&nbsp;received her; and bearing her up when swimming,
I&nbsp;said, ‘O thou bearer of the Trident, who hast obtained, by lot,
next in rank to the heavens, the realms of the flowing waters, in which
we sacred rivers end, <i>and</i> to which we run; come hither, Neptune,
and graciously listen to me, as I pray. Her, whom I am bearing up,
I&nbsp;have injured. If her father, Hippodamas, had been mild and
reasonable, or if he had been less unnatural, he ought to have pitied
her, and to have forgiven me. Give thy assistance; and grant a place,
Neptune, I&nbsp;beseech thee, to her, plunged in the waters by the
cruelty of her father; or allow her to become a place herself. Her,
even, <i>thus</i> will I embrace.’ The King of the ocean moved his head,
and shook all the waters with his assent. The Nymph was afraid; but yet
she swam. Her breast, as she was swimming, I&nbsp;myself touched, as it
throbbed with a tremulous motion; and while I felt it, I&nbsp;perceived
her whole body grow hard, and her breast become covered with earth
growing over it. While I was speaking, fresh earth enclosed her floating
limbs, and a heavy island grew upon her changed members.”</p>

This story is simply based upon physical grounds. The river Acheloüs,
running between Acarnania and Ætolia, and flowing into the Ionian Sea,
carried with it a great quantity of sand and mud, which probably formed
the islands at its mouth, called the Echinades. The same solution
probably applies to the narrative of the fate of the Nymph Perimele.</p>

life, the worthy couple are changed into trees. The village where they
live is laid under water, on account of the impiety of the inhabitants,
and is turned into a lake. Acheloüs here relates the surprising changes
of Proteus.</p>


<p>After these things the river was silent. The wondrous deed

immense, and has no limits; and whatever the Gods above will, ’tis
done.</p>

<p>“And that thou mayst the less doubt <i>of this</i>, there is upon the
Phrygian hills, an oak near to the lime tree, enclosed by a low wall.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag8_83" id = "tag8_83" href = "#note8_83">83</a>
I, myself, have seen the spot; for Pittheus sent me into the land of
Pelops, once governed by his father, <i>Pelops</i>. Not far thence is a
standing water, formerly habitable ground, but now frequented by
cormorants and coots, that delight in fens. Jupiter came hither in the
shape of a man, and together with his parent, the grandson of Atlas,
<i>Mercury</i>, the bearer of the Caduceus, having laid aside his wings.
To a thousand houses did they go, asking for lodging and for rest.
A&nbsp;thousand houses did the bolts fasten <i>against them</i>. Yet one

reeds of the marsh. But a pious old woman <i>named</i> Baucis, and
Philemon of a like age, were united in their youthful years in that
<i>cottage</i>, and in it, they grew old together; and by owning their
poverty, they rendered it light, and not to be endured with discontented
mind. It matters not, whether you ask for the masters there, or for the
servants; the whole family are but two; the same persons both obey and
command. When, therefore, the inhabitants of heaven reached this little
abode, and, bending their necks, entered the humble door, the old man
bade them rest their limbs on a bench set <i>there</i>; upon which the
attentive Baucis threw a coarse cloth. Then she moves the warm embers on
the hearth, and stirs

up the fire they had had the day before, and supplies it with leaves and
dry bark, and with her aged breath kindles it into a flame; and brings
out of the house faggots split into many pieces, and dry bits of
branches, and breaks them, and puts them beneath a small boiler. Some
pot-herbs, too, which her husband has gathered in the well-watered
garden, she strips of their leaves.</p>

<p>“With a two-pronged fork <i>Philemon</i> lifts down<a class = "tag"

side of bacon, that hangs from a black beam; and cuts off a small
portion from the chine that has been kept so long; and when cut, softens
it in boiling water. In the meantime, with discourse they beguile the
intervening hours; and suffer not the length of time to be perceived.
There is a beechen trough there, that hangs on a peg by its crooked
handle; this is filled with warm water, and receives their limbs to
refresh them. On the middle of the couch, its feet and frame<a class =

made of willow, is placed a cushion of soft sedge. This they cover with
cloths, which they have not been accustomed to place there but on
festive occasions; but even these cloths are coarse and old,
<i>though</i> not unfitting for a couch of willow. The Gods seat
themselves. The old woman, wearing an apron, and shaking <i>with

table is too short; a&nbsp;potsherd, <i>placed beneath</i>, makes it
equal. After this, being placed beneath, has taken away the inequality,

After this, an embossed goblet of

the warm repast; and wine kept no long time, is again put on; and
<i>then</i>, set aside for a little time, it gives place to the second
course. Here are nuts, <i>and</i> here are dried figs mixed with
wrinkled dates, plums too, and fragrant apples in wide baskets, and
grapes gathered from the purple vines. In the middle there is white
honey-comb. Above all, there are welcome looks, and no indifferent and
niggardly feelings. In the meanwhile, as oft as Baucis and the alarmed
Philemon behold the goblet, <i>when</i> drunk off, replenish itself of
its own accord, and the wine increase of itself, astonished at this
singular event, they are frightened, and, with hands held up, they offer
their prayers, and entreat pardon for their entertainment, and their
want of preparation. There was a single goose, the guardian of their
little cottage, which its owners were preparing to kill for the Deities,
their guests. Swift with its wings, it wearied them, <i>rendered</i>
slow by age, and it escaped them a long time, and at length seemed to
fly for safety to the Gods themselves. The immortals forbade it<a class

killed, and said, ‘We are Divinities, and this impious neighbourhood
shall suffer deserved punishment. To you it will be allowed to be free
from this calamity; only leave your habitation, and attend our steps,
and go together to the summit of the mountain.’</p>

<p>“They both obeyed; and, supported by staffs, they endeavoured to
place their feet <i>on the top</i> of the high hill. They were
<i>now</i> as far from the top, as an arrow discharged can go at once,
<i>when</i> they turned their eyes, and beheld the other parts sinking
in a morass, <i>and</i> their own abode alone remaining. While they were
wondering at these things, <i>and</i> while they were bewailing the fate
of their <i>fellow countrymen</i>, that old cottage of <i>theirs</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 699-734.</span>
<i>too</i> little for even two owners, was changed into a temple.
Columns took the place of forked stakes, the thatch grew yellow, and the
earth was covered with marble; the doors appeared carved, and the roof
to be of gold. Then, the son of Saturn uttered such words as these with
benign lips: ‘Tell us, good old man, and thou, wife, worthy of a husband
<i>so</i> good, what it is you desire?’ Having spoken a few words to
Baucis, Philemon discovered their joint request to the Gods: ‘We desire
to be your priests, and to have the care of your temple; and, since we
have passed our years in harmony, let the same hour take us off both
together; and let me not ever see the tomb of my wife, nor let me be
destined to be buried by her.’ Fulfilment attended their wishes. So long
as life was granted, they were the keepers of the temple; and when,
enervated by years and old age, they were standing, by chance, before
the sacred steps, and were relating the fortunes of the spot, Baucis
beheld Philemon, and the aged Philemon saw Baucis, <i>too</i>, shooting
into leaf. And now the tops of the trees growing above their two faces,
so long as they could they exchanged words with each other, and said
together, ‘Farewell! my spouse;’ and at the same moment the branches
covered their concealed faces. The inhabitants of Tyana<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8_90" id = "tag8_90" href = "#note8_90">90</a> still shew
these adjoining trees, made of their two bodies. Old men, no romancers,
(and there was no reason why they should wish to deceive me) told me
this. I, indeed, saw garlands hanging on the branches, and placing
<i>there</i> some fresh ones <i>myself</i>, I&nbsp;said, ‘The good are
the <i>peculiar</i> care of the Gods, and those who worshipped <i>the
Gods</i>, are <i>now</i> worshipped <i>themselves</i>.’”</p>

<p>He had <i>now</i> ceased; and the thing <i>itself</i> and the relator
<i>of it</i> had astonished them all; <i>and</i> especially Theseus,
whom, desiring to hear of the wonderful actions of the Gods, the
Calydonian river leaning on his elbow, addressed in words such as these:
“There are, O&nbsp;most valiant <i>hero</i>, some things, whose form has
been once changed, and <i>then</i> has continued under that change.
There are some whose privilege it is to pass into many shapes, as thou,
Proteus, inhabitant of the sea that embraces the earth. For people have
seen thee one while a young man, and again a lion; at one time thou wast
a furious boar, at another a serpent, which they dreaded to touch;
<i>and</i>

sometimes, horns rendered thee a bull. Ofttimes thou mightst be seen as
a stone; often, too, as a tree. Sometimes imitating the appearance of
flowing water, thou wast a river; sometimes fire, the <i>very</i>
contrary of water.”</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Baucis and Philemon, which is here so beautifully related
by the Poet, is a moral tale, which shows the merit of hospitality, and
how, in some cases at least, virtue speedily brings its own reward. If
the story is based upon any actual facts, the history of its origin is
entirely unknown. Huet, the theologian, indeed, supposes that it is
founded on the history of the reception of the Angels by Abraham. This
is a bold surmise, but entirely in accordance with his position, that
the greatest part of the fictions of the heathen mythology were mere
glosses or perversions of the histories of the Old Testament. If derived
from Scripture, the story is just as likely to be founded on the
hospitable reception of the Prophet Elijah by the woman of Zarephath;
and the miraculous increase of the wine in the goblet, calls to mind
‘the barrel of meal that wasted not, and the cruse of oil that did not
fail.’ The story of the wretched fate of the inhospitable neighbours of
Baucis and Philemon is thought, by some modern writers, to be founded
upon the Scriptural account of the destruction of the wicked cities of
the plain.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ancient writers have made many attempts to solve the wondrous story of
Proteus. Some say that he was an elegant orator, who charmed his
auditors by the force of his eloquence. Lucian says that he was an actor
of pantomime, so supple that he could assume various postures.
Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Clement of Alexandria, assert that he
was an ancient king of Egypt, successor to Pheron, and that he lived at
the time, of the Trojan war. Herodotus, who represents him as a prince
of great wisdom and justice, does not make any allusion to his powers of
transformation, which was his great merit in the eyes of the poets.
Diodorus Siculus says that his alleged changes may have had their rise
in a custom which Proteus had of adorning his helmet, sometimes with the
skin of a panther, sometimes with that of a lion, and sometimes with
that of a serpent, or of some other animal. When Lycophron states that
Neptune saved Proteus from the fury of his children, by making him go
through caverns from Pallene to Egypt, he follows the tradition which
says that he originally came from that town in Thessaly, and that he
retired thence to Egypt. Virgil, and Servius, his Commentator, assert
that Proteus returned to Thessaly after the death of his children, who
were slain by Hercules; in which assertion, however, they are not
supported by Homer or Herodotus.</p>

<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">Acheloüs</span> continues his narrative with
the story of Metra, the daughter of Erisicthon, who is attacked with
insatiable hunger, for having cut down an oak, in one of the groves of
Ceres. Metra begs of Neptune, who was formerly in love with her, the
power of transforming herself into different shapes; that she may be
enabled, if possible, to satisfy the voracious appetite of her father.
By these means, Erisicthon, being obliged to expose her for sale, in
order to purchase himself food, always recovers her again; until, by his
repeated sale of her, the fraud is discovered. He at last becomes the
avenger of his own impiety, by devouring his own limbs.</p>

<p>“Nor has the wife of Autolycus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_91" id =
"tag8_91" href = "#note8_91">91</a> the daughter of Erisicthon, less
privileges <i>than he</i>. Her father was one who despised the majesty
of the Gods; and he offered them no honours on their altars. He is
likewise said to have profaned with an axe a grove of Ceres, and to have
violated her ancient woods with the iron. In these there was standing an
oak with an ancient trunk, a&nbsp;wood <i>in itself</i> alone, fillets
and tablets, <i>as</i> memorials,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_92" id =
"tag8_92" href = "#note8_92">92</a> and garlands, proofs of wishes that
had been granted, surrounded the middle of it. Often, beneath this
<i>tree</i>, did the Dryads lead up the festive dance; often, too, with
hands joined in order, did they go round the compass of its trunk; and
the girth of the oak made up three times five ells. The rest of the
wood, too, lay as much under this oak as the grass lay beneath the whole
of the wood. Yet not on that account <i>even</i> did the son of
Triopas<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_93" id = "tag8_93" href =
"#note8_93">93</a> withhold the axe from it; and he ordered his servants
to cut down the sacred oak; and when he saw them hesitate, <i>thus</i>
ordered, the wicked <i>wretch</i>, snatching from one of them an axe,
uttered these words: ‘Were it not only beloved by a Goddess, but even
were it a Goddess itself, it should now touch the ground with its leafy
top.’ <i>Thus</i> he said; and while he was poising his weapon for a
side stroke, the Deoïan oak<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_94" id =
"tag8_94" href = "#note8_94">94</a> shuddered, and uttered a groan; and
<span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 759-793.</span>
at once, its green leaves, and, with them, its acorns began to turn
pale; and the long branches to be moistened with sweat. As soon as his
impious hand had made an incision in its trunk, the blood flowed from
the severed bark no otherwise than, as, at the time when the bull,
a&nbsp;large victim, falls before the altars, the blood pours forth from
his divided neck. All were amazed and one of the number attempted to
hinder the wicked design, and to restrain the cruel axe. The Thessalian
eyes him, and says, ‘Take the reward of thy pious intentions,’ and turns
the axe from the tree upon the man, and hews off his head; and
<i>then</i> hacks at the oak again; when such words as these are uttered
from the middle of the oak: ‘I, a&nbsp;Nymph,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_95" id = "tag8_95" href = "#note8_95">95</a> most pleasing to
Ceres, am beneath this wood; I, <i>now</i> dying, foretell to thee that
the punishment of thy deeds, the solace of my death, is at hand.’</p>

<p>“He pursued his wicked design; and, at last, weakened by numberless
blows, and pulled downward with ropes, the tree fell down, and with its
weight levelled a great part of the wood. All her sisters, the Dryads,
being shocked at the loss of the grove and their own, in their grief
repaired to Ceres, in black array,<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_96" id =
"tag8_96" href = "#note8_96">96</a> and requested the punishment of
Erisicthon. She assented to their <i>request</i>, and the most beauteous
Goddess, with the nodding of her head, shook the fields loaded with the
heavy crops; and contrived <i>for him</i> a kind of punishment,
lamentable, if he had not, for his crimes, been deserving of the
sympathy of none, <i>namely</i>, to torment him with deadly Famine. And
since that Goddess could not be approached by herself (for the Destinies
do not allow Ceres and Famine to come together), in such words as these
she addressed rustic Oreas, one of the mountain Deities: ‘There is an
icy region in the extreme part of Scythia, a&nbsp;dreary soil,
a&nbsp;land, desolate, without corn <i>and</i> without trees; there
dwell drowsy Cold, and Paleness, and Trembling, and famishing Hunger;
order her to bury herself in the breast of this sacrilegious
<i>wretch</i>. Let no abundance of provisions overcome her;
<span class = "pagenum">296</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 793-824.</span>
and let her surpass my powers in the contest. And that the length of the
road may not alarm thee, take my chariot, take the dragons, which thou
mayst guide aloft with the reins;’ and <i>then</i> she gave them to
her.</p>

<p>“She, borne through the air on the chariot <i>thus</i> granted,
arrived in Scythia; and, on the top of a steep mountain (they call it
Caucasus), she unyoked the neck of the dragons, and beheld Famine, whom
she was seeking, in a stony field, tearing up herbs, growing here and
there, with her nails and with her teeth. Rough was her hair, her eyes
hollow, paleness on her face, her lips white with scurf,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8_97" id = "tag8_97" href = "#note8_97">97</a> her jaws rough
with rustiness; her skin hard, through which her bowels might be seen;
her dry bones were projecting beneath her crooked loins; instead of a
belly, there was <i>only</i> the place for a belly. You would think her
breast was hanging, and was only supported from the chine<a class =
"tag" name = "tag8_98" id = "tag8_98" href = "#note8_98">98</a> of the
back. Leanness had, <i>to appearance</i>, increased her joints, and the
caps of her knees were stiff, and excrescences projected from her
overgrown ancles. Soon as <i>Oreas</i> beheld her at a distance (for she
did not dare come near her), she delivered the commands of the Goddess;
and, staying for so short a time, although she was at a distance from
her, <i>and</i> although she had just come thither, still did she seem
to feel hunger; and, turning the reins, she drove aloft the dragon’s
back to Hæmonia.</p>

<p>“Famine executes the orders of Ceres (although she is ever opposing
her operations), and is borne by the winds through the air to the
assigned abode, and immediately enters the bedchamber of the
sacrilegious <i>wretch</i>, and embraces him, sunk in a deep sleep
(<i>for</i> it is night-time), with her two wings. She breathes herself
into the man, and blows upon his jaws, and his breast, and his face; and
she scatters hunger through his empty veins. And having <i>thus</i>
executed her commission, she forsakes the fruitful world, and returns to
her famished abode, her wonted fields. Gentle sleep is still soothing<a
class = "tag" name = "tag8_99" id = "tag8_99" href = "#note8_99">99</a>
Erisicthon with its balmy wings. In a vision of his
<span class = "pagenum">297</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 824-857.</span>
sleep he craves for food, and moves his jaws to no purpose, and tires
his teeth <i>grinding</i> upon teeth, and wearies his throat deluded
with imaginary food; and, instead of victuals, he devours in vain the
yielding air. But when sleep is banished, his desire for eating is
outrageous, and holds sway over his craving jaws, and his insatiate
entrails. And no delay <i>is there</i>; he calls what the sea, what the
earth, what the air produces, and complains of hunger with the tables
set before him, and requires food in <i>the midst of</i> food. And what
might be enough for <i>whole</i> cities, and what <i>might be enough</i>
for a <i>whole</i> people, is not sufficient for one man. The more, too,
he swallows down into his stomach, the more does he desire. And just as
the ocean receives rivers from the whole earth, and <i>yet</i> is not
satiated with water, and drinks up the rivers of distant countries, and
as the devouring fire never refuses fuel, and burns up beams of wood
without number, and the greater the quantity that is given to it, the
more does it crave, and it is the more voracious through the very
abundance <i>of fuel</i>; so do the jaws of the impious Erisicthon
receive all victuals <i>presented</i>, and at the same time ask for
<i>more</i>. In him all food is <i>only</i> a ground for <i>more</i>
food, and there is always room vacant for eating <i>still more</i>.</p>

<p>“And now, through his appetite, and the voracity of his capacious
stomach, he had diminished his paternal estate; but yet, even then, did
his shocking hunger remain undiminished, and the craving of his
insatiable appetite continued in full vigour. At last, after he has
swallowed down his estate into his paunch,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_100" id = "tag8_100" href = "#note8_100">100</a> his daughter
<i>alone</i> is remaining, undeserving of him for a father; her, too, he
sells, pressed by want. Born of a noble race, she cannot brook a master;
and stretching out her hands, over the neighbouring sea, she says,
‘Deliver me from a master, thou who dost possess the prize of my
ravished virginity.’ This <i>prize</i> Neptune had <i>possessed himself
of</i>. He, not despising her prayer, although, the moment before, she
has been seen by her master in pursuit of her, both alters her form, and
gives her the appearance of a man, and a habit befitting such as catch
fish. Looking at her, her master says, ‘O thou manager of the rod, who
dost cover the brazen <i>hook</i>, as it hangs, with tiny morsels, even
so may the sea be smooth <i>for thee</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">298</span>
<span class = "linenum">viii. 857-884.</span>
even so may the fish in the water be <i>ever</i> credulous for thee, and
may they perceive no hook till caught; tell me where she is, who this
moment was standing upon this shore (for standing on the shore I saw
her), with her hair dishevelled, <i>and</i> in humble garb; for no
further do her footsteps extend.’ She perceives that the favour of the
God has turned to good purpose, and, well pleased that she is inquired
after of herself, she replies to him, as he inquires, in these words:
‘Whoever thou art, excuse me, <i>but</i> I have not turned my eyes on
any side from this water, and, busily employed, I&nbsp;have been
attending to my pursuit. And that thou mayst the less disbelieve
<i>me</i>, may the God of the sea so aid this employment of mine, no man
has been for some time standing on this shore, myself only excepted, nor
has any woman been standing <i>here</i><ins class = "correction" title =
"” for ’">.’</ins> Her master believed her, and, turning his feet <i>to
go away</i>, he paced the sands, and, <i>thus</i> deceived, withdrew.
Her own shape was restored to her.</p>

<p>“But when her father found that his <i>daughter</i> had a body
capable of being transformed, he often sold the grand-daughter of
Triopas to <i>other</i> masters. But she used to escape, sometimes as a
mare, sometimes as a bird, now as a cow, now as a stag; and <i>so</i>
provided a dishonest maintenance for her hungry parent. Yet, after this
violence of his distemper had consumed all his provision, and had added
fresh fuel to his dreadful malady: he himself, with mangling bites,
began to tear his own limbs, and the miserable <i>wretch</i> used to
feed his own body by diminishing it. <i>But</i> why do I dwell on the
instances of others? I, too, O&nbsp;youths,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_101" id = "tag8_101" href = "#note8_101">101</a> have a power of
often changing my body, <i>though</i> limited in the number <i>of those
changes</i>. For, one while, I&nbsp;appear what I now am, another while
I am wreathed as a snake; then <i>as</i> the leader of a herd,
I&nbsp;receive strength in my horns. In my horns, <i>I&nbsp;say</i>, so
long as I could. Now, one side of my forehead is deprived of its
weapons, as thou seest thyself.” Sighs followed his words.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Metra and Erisicthon has no other foundation, in all
probability, than the diligent care which she took, as a dutiful
daughter, to
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>
support her father, when he had ruined himself by his luxury and
extravagance. She, probably, was a young woman, who, in the hour of
need, could, in common parlance, ‘turn her hand’ to any useful
employment. Some, however, suppose that, by her changes are meant the
wages she received from those whom she served in the capacity of a
slave, and which she gave to her father; and it must be remembered that,
in ancient times, as money was scarce, the wages of domestics were often
paid in kind. Other writers again suggest, less to the credit of the
damsel, that her changes denote the price she received for her
debaucheries. Ovid adds, that she married Autolycus, the robber, who
stole the oxen of Eurytus. Callimachus also, in his Hymn to Ceres, gives
the story of Erisicthon at length. He was the great grandfather of
Ulysses, and was probably a man noted for his infidelity and impiety, as
well as his riotous course of life. The story is probably of Eastern
origin, and if a little expanded might vie with many of the interesting
fictions which we read in the Arabian Night’s Entertainments.</p>

this bird was of variegated colours, with a purple breast, and legs of a
reddish hue, and lived a solitary life in retired spots. It is uncertain
what kind of bird it was; some think it was a hawk, some a lark, and
others a partridge. It has been suggested that Ovid did not enter into
the details of this transformation, because it had been so recently
depicted in beautiful language by Virgil. Hyginus says that the ‘Ciris’

<i>Funeral offering.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 490. The ‘inferiæ’ were sacrifices
offered to the shades of the dead. The Romans appear to have regarded
the souls of the departed as Gods; for which reason they presented them

Cleopatra, but Hyginus says that her name was Alcyone. Homer, however,
reconciles this discrepancy, by saying that the original name of the
wife of Meleager was Cleopatra, but that she was called Alcyone, because
her mother had the same fate as Alcyone, or Halcyone.</p>

<i>Opposed his journey.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 548. It has been objected to
this passage, that the river Acheloüs, which rises in Mount Pindus, and
divides Acarnania from Ætolia, could not possibly lie in the road of
Theseus, as he returned from Calydon to Athens.</p>

<p><a name = "note8_79" id = "note8_79" href = "#tag8_79">79.</a>
<i>Son of Ixion.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 566. Pirithoüs lay on the one side, and

<i>Thatched with straw.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 630. It was the custom with the
ancients, when reaping, to take off only the heads of the corn, and to
leave the stubble to be reaped at another time. From this passage, we
see that straw was used for the purpose of thatching.</p>

<p><a name = "note8_85" id = "note8_85" href = "#tag8_85">85.</a>
<i>Lifts down.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 647. The lifting down the flitch of bacon
might induce us to believe that the account of this story was written
yesterday, and not nearly two thousand years since. So true is it, that
there is nothing new under the sun.</p>

<p><a name = "note8_86" id = "note8_86" href = "#tag8_86">86.</a>
<i>Feet and frame.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 659. ‘Sponda.’ This was the frame of
the bedstead, and more especially the sides of it. In the case of a bed
used for two persons, the two sides were distinguished by different
names; the side at which they entered was open, and was called ‘sponda:’
the other side, which was protected by a board, was called ‘pluteus.’
The two sides were also called ‘torus exterior,’ or ‘sponda exterior,’
and ‘torus interior,’ or ‘sponda interior.’</p>

<i>A short pause.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 671. This was the second course. The
Roman ‘cœna,’ or chief meal, consisted of three stages. First, the
‘promulsis,’ ‘antecœna,’ or ‘gustatio,’ when they ate such things as
served to stimulate the appetite. Then came the first course, which
formed the substantial part of the meal; and next the second course, at
which the ‘bellaria,’ consisting of pastry and fruits, such as are now
used at dessert, were served.</p>

<p><a name = "note8_89" id = "note8_89" href = "#tag8_89">89.</a>
<i>Immortals forbade it.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 688. This act of humanity
reflects credit on the two Deities, and contrasts favourably with their
usual cruel and revengeful disposition, in common with their fellow
Divinities of the heathen Mythology.</p>

<i>In black array.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 778. The Romans wore mourning for the
dead; which seems, in the time of the Republic, to have been black or
dark blue for either sex. Under the Empire, the men continued to wear
black, but the women wore white. On such occasions all ornaments were
laid aside.</p>

Acheloüs, to gain the advantage over his rival, transforms himself into
various shapes, and, at length, into that of a bull. These attempts are
in vain, and Hercules overcomes him, and breaks off one of his horns.
The Naiads, the daughters of Acheloüs, take it up, and fill it with the

the Horn of Plenty.</p>

nor <i>am I some</i> stranger sent thee for a son-in-law, from foreign
lands, but I shall be one of thy people, and a part of thy state. Only
let it not be to my prejudice, that the royal Juno does not hate me, and
that all punishment, by labours enjoined, is afar from me. For, since
thou, <i>Hercules</i>, dost boast thyself born of Alcmena for thy
mother; Jupiter is either thy pretended sire, or thy real one through a
criminal deed: by the adultery of thy mother art thou claiming a father.
Choose, <i>then</i>, whether thou wouldst rather have Jupiter <i>for
thy</i> pretended <i>father</i>, or that thou art sprung <i>from him</i>
through a disgraceful deed?’</p>

<p>“While I was saying such things as these, for some time he looked at
me with a scowling eye, and did not very successfully check his inflamed
wrath; and he returned me just as many words <i>as these</i>: ‘My right
hand is better than my tongue. If only I do but prevail in fighting, do
thou get the better in talking;’ and <i>then</i> he fiercely
<i>attacked</i> me. I&nbsp;was ashamed, after having so lately spoken
big words, to yield. I&nbsp;threw on one side my green garment from off
my body, and opposed my arms <i>to his</i>, and I held my hands bent
inwards,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_5" id = "tag9_5" href =
"#note9_5">5</a> from before my breast, on their guard, and I prepared
my limbs for the combat. He sprinkled me with dust, taken up in the
hollow of his hands, and, in his turn, grew yellow with the casting of
yellow sand<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_6" id = "tag9_6" href =
"#note9_6">6</a> <i>upon himself</i>. And at one moment he aimed at my
neck, at another my legs, as they shifted about, or you would suppose he
was aiming <i>at them</i>; and he assaulted me on every side. My bulk
defended me, and I was attacked in vain; no

<span class = "linenum">ix. 39-71.</span>
otherwise than a mole, which the waves beat against with loud noise: it
remains <i>unshaken</i>, and by its own weight is secure.</p>

<p>“We retire a little, and <i>then</i> again we rush together in
conflict, and we stand firm, determined not to yield; foot, too, is
joined to foot; and <i>then</i> I, bending forward full with my breast,
press upon his fingers with my fingers, and his forehead with my
forehead. In no different manner have I beheld the strong bulls engage,
when the most beauteous mate<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_7" id =
"tag9_7" href = "#note9_7">7</a> in all the pasture is sought as the
reward of the combat; the herds look on and tremble, uncertain which the
mastery of so great a domain awaits. Thrice without effect did Alcides
attempt to hurl away from him my breast, as it bore hard against him;
the fourth time, he shook off my hold, and loosened my arms clasped
around him; and, striking me with his hand, (I&nbsp;am resolved to
confess the truth) he turned me quite round, and clung, a&nbsp;mighty
load, to my back. If any credit <i>is to be given me</i>, (and, indeed,
no glory is sought by me through an untrue narration) I&nbsp;seemed to
myself <i>as though</i> weighed down with a mountain placed upon me.
Yet, with great difficulty, I&nbsp;disengaged my arms streaming with
much perspiration, <i>and</i>, with great exertion, I&nbsp;unlocked his
firm grasp from my body. He pressed on me as I panted for breath, and
prevented me from recovering my strength, and <i>then</i> seized hold of
my neck. Then, at last, was the earth pressed by my knee, and with my
mouth I bit the sand. Inferior in strength, I&nbsp;had recourse to my
arts,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_8" id = "tag9_8" href =
"#note9_8">8</a> and transformed into a long serpent, I&nbsp;escaped
from the hero.</p>

<p>“After I had twisted my body into winding folds, and darted my forked
tongue with dreadful hissings, the Tirynthian laughed, and deriding my
arts, he said, ‘It was the labour of my cradle to conquer serpents;<a

although, Acheloüs, thou shouldst excel other snakes, how large a part
wilt thou, <i>but</i> one serpent, be of the Lernæan Echidna? By her
<i>very</i> wounds was she multiplied, and not one head of her hundred

myself</i>; but rather so that her neck became stronger, with two
successors <i>to the former head</i>. <i>Yet</i> her I subdued,
branching with serpents springing from <i>each</i> wound, and growing
stronger by her disasters; and, <i>so</i> subdued, I&nbsp;slew her. What
canst thou think will become of thee, who, changed into a fictitious
serpent, art wielding arms that belong to another, and whom a form,
obtained as a favour, is <i>now</i> disguising?’ <i>Thus</i> he spoke;
and he planted the grip of his fingers on the upper part of my neck.
I&nbsp;was tortured, just as though my throat was squeezed with pincers;
and I struggled hard to disengage my jaws from his fingers.</p>

<p>“Thus vanquished, too, there still remained for me my third form,
<i>that</i> of a furious bull; with my limbs changed into <i>those
of</i> a bull I renewed the fight. He threw his arms over my brawny
neck, on the left side, and, dragging <i>at me</i>, followed me in my
onward course; and seizing my horns, he fastened them in the hard
ground, and felled me upon the deep sand. And that was not enough; while
his relentless right hand was holding my stubborn horn, he broke it, and
tore it away from my mutilated forehead. This, heaped with fruit and
odoriferous flowers, the Naiads have consecrated, and the bounteous
<i>Goddess</i>, Plenty, is enriched by my horn.” <i>Thus</i> he said;
but a Nymph, girt up after the manner of Diana, one of his handmaids,
with her hair hanging loose on either side, came in, and brought the
whole <i>of the produce</i> of Autumn in the most plentiful horn, and
choice fruit for a second course.</p>

<p>Day comes on, and the rising sun striking the tops of the hills, the
young men depart; nor do they stay till the stream has quiet <i>restored
to it</i>, and a smooth course, and <i>till</i> the troubled waters
subside. Acheloüs conceals his rustic features, and his mutilated horn,
in the midst of the waves; yet the loss of this honour, taken from him,
<i>alone</i> affects him; in other respects, he is unhurt. The injury,
too, which has befallen his head, is <i>now</i> concealed with willow
branches, or with reeds placed upon&nbsp;it.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The river Acheloüs, which ran between Acarnania and Ætolia, often did
considerable damage to those countries by its inundations, and, at the
same time, by confounding or sweeping away the limits which separated
those nations, it engaged them in continual warfare with each other.
Hercules, who seems really to have been a person of great scientific
skill, which he was ever ready to employ for the service of his fellow
men, raised banks to it, and made its course so uniform and straight,
that he was the means of establishing perpetual peace between these
adjoining nations.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The early authors who recorded these events have narrated them under a
thick and almost impenetrable veil of fiction. They say that Hercules
engaged in combat with the God of that river, who immediately
transformed himself into a serpent, by which was probably meant merely
the serpentine windings of its course. Next they say, that the God
changed himself into a bull, under which allegorical form they refer to
the rapid and impetuous overflowing of its banks, ever rushing onwards,
bearing down everything in its course, and leaving traces of its ravages
throughout the country in its vicinity. This mode of description the
more readily occurred to them in the case of Acheloüs, as from the
roaring noise which they often make in their course, rivers in general
were frequently represented under the figure of a bull, and, of course,
as wearing horns, the great instruments of the havoc which they
created.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It was said, then, that Hercules at length overcame this bull, and broke
off one of his horns; by which was meant, according to Strabo, that he
brought both the branches of the river into one channel. Again, this
horn became the Horn of Plenty in that region; or, in other words, being
withdrawn from its bed, the river left a large track of very fertile
ground for agricultural purposes. As to the Cornucopia, or Horn of
Plenty of the heathen Mythology, there is some variation in the accounts
respecting it. Some writers say that by it was meant the horn of the
goat Amalthea, which suckled Jupiter, and that the Nymphs gave it to
Acheloüs, who again gave it in exchange for that of which Hercules
afterwards deprived him. Deïanira, having given her hand to Hercules, as
the recompense of the important services which he had rendered to her
father, Œneus, it was fabled that she had been promised to Acheloüs, who
was vanquished by his rival; and on this foundation was built the
superstructure of the famous combat which the Poet here describes. After
having remained for some time at the court of his father-in-law,
Hercules was obliged to leave it, in consequence of having killed the
son of Architritilus, who was the cupbearer of that prince.</p>

<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">Hercules</span>, returning with Deïanira, as
the prize of his victory, entrusts her to the Centaur Nessus, to carry
her over the river Evenus. Nessus seizes the opportunity of Hercules
being on the other side of the river, and attempts to carry her off; on
which Hercules, perceiving his design, shoots him with an arrow, and
thus prevents its execution. The Centaur, when expiring, in order to
gratify his revenge, gives Deïanira his tunic dipped in his blood,
assuring her that it contains an effectual charm against all infidelity
on the part of her husband. Afterwards, on hearing that Hercules is in
love with Iole, Deïanira sends him the tunic, that it may have the
supposed effect. As soon as he puts it on, he is affected with
excruciating torments, and is seized with such violent fits of madness,
that he throws Lychas, the bearer of the garment, into the sea, where he
is changed into a rock. Hercules, then, in obedience to a response of
the oracle, which he consults, prepares a funeral pile, and laying
himself upon it, his friend Philoctetes applies the torch to it, on
which the hero, having first recounted his labours, expires in the
flames. After his body is consumed, Jupiter translates him to the
heavens, and he is placed in the number of the Gods.</p>

<p>But a passion for this same maiden proved fatal to thee, fierce
Nessus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_11" id = "tag9_11" href =
"#note9_11">11</a> pierced through the back with a swift arrow. For the
son of Jupiter, as he was returning to his native city with his new-made
wife, had <i>now</i> come to the rapid waters of <i>the river</i>
Evenus.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_12" id = "tag9_12" href =
"#note9_12">12</a> The stream was swollen to a greater extent than usual
with the winter rains, and was full of whirlpools, and impassable.
Nessus came up to him, regardless of himself, <i>but</i> feeling anxiety
for his wife, both strong of limb,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_13" id =
"tag9_13" href = "#note9_13">13</a> and well acquainted with the fords,
and said, “Alcides, she shall be landed on yonder bank through my
services, do thou employ thy strength in swimming;” and the Aonian
<i>hero</i> entrusted to Nessus the Calydonian damsel full of alarm, and
pale with apprehension, and <i>equally</i> dreading both the river and
<i>Nessus</i> himself. Immediately, just as he was, loaded both with his
quiver and the spoil of the lion, (for he had thrown his club and his
crooked bow to the opposite side), he said, “Since I have undertaken it,
the stream must be passed.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">306</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 118-142.</span>

<p>And he does not hesitate; nor does he seek out where the stream is
the smoothest, and he spurns to be borne over by the compliance of the
river. And now having reached the bank, and as he is taking up the bow
which he had thrown over, he recognizes the voice of his wife; and as
Nessus is preparing to rob him of what he has entrusted to his care, he
cries out, “Whither, thou ravisher, does thy vain confidence in thy feet
hurry thee? to thee am I speaking, Nessus, thou two-shaped
<i>monster</i>. Listen; and do not carry off my property. If no regard
for myself influences thee, still the wheel of thy father<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9_14" id = "tag9_14" href = "#note9_14">14</a> might
have restrained thee from forbidden embraces. Thou shall not escape,
however, although thou dost confide<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_15" id
= "tag9_15" href = "#note9_15">15</a> in thy powers of a horse; with a
wound, <i>and</i> not with my feet, will I overtake thee.” <i>These</i>
last words he confirms by deeds, and pierces him through the back, as he
is flying, with an arrow discharged <i>at him</i>. The barbed steel
stands out from his breast; soon as it is wrenched out, the blood gushes
forth from both wounds, mingled with the venom of the Lernæan poison.
Nessus takes it out, and says to himself, “And yet I shall not die
unrevenged;” and gives his garment, dyed in the warm blood, as a present
to her whom he is carrying off, as though an incentive to love.</p>

<p>Long was the space of intervening time, and the feats of the mighty
Hercules and the hatred of his step-mother had filled the earth.
<i>Returning</i> victorious from Œchalia, he is preparing a sacrifice
which he had vowed to Cenæan Jupiter,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_16"
id = "tag9_16" href = "#note9_16">16</a> when tattling Rumour (who takes
pleasure in adding false things to the truth, and from a very little
<i>beginning</i>, swells to a great bulk by her lies) runs before to thy
ears, Deïanira, <i>to the effect</i> that the son of Amphitryon is
seized with a passion for Iole. As she loves him, she believes it; and
being alarmed with the report of this new amour, at first she indulges
in
<span class = "pagenum">307</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 142-175.</span>
tears and in her misery gives vent to her grief in weeping. Soon,
however, she says, “But why do I weep? My rival will be delighted with
these tears; and since she is coming I must make haste, and some
contrivance must be resolved on while it is <i>still</i> possible, and
while, as yet, another has not taken possession of my bed. Shall I
complain, or shall I be silent? Shall I return to Calydon, or shall I
stay here? Shall I depart from this abode? or, if nothing more, shall I
oppose <i>their entrance</i>? What if, O&nbsp;Meleager, remembering that
I am thy sister, I&nbsp;resolve on a desperate deed, and testify, by
murdering my rival, how much, injury and a woman’s grief can
effect?”</p>

<p>Her mind wavers, amid various resolves. Before them all, she prefers
to send the garment dyed in the blood of Nessus, to restore strength to
his declining love. Not knowing herself what she is giving, she delivers
<i>the cause of</i> her own sorrows to the unsuspecting Lichas,<a class
= "tag" name = "tag9_17" id = "tag9_17" href = "#note9_17">17</a> and
bids him, in gentle words, to deliver this most fatal gift to her
husband. In his ignorance, the hero receives it, and places upon his
shoulders the venom of the Lernæan Echidna. He is placing frankincense
on the rising flames, and <i>is offering</i> the words of prayer, and
pouring wine from the bowl upon the marble altars. The virulence of the
bane waxes warm, and, melted by the flames, it runs, widely diffused
over the limbs of Hercules. So long as he is able, he suppresses his
groans with his wonted fortitude. After his endurance is overcome by his
anguish, he pushes down the altars, and fills the woody Œta with his
cries. There is no <i>further</i> delay; he attempts to tear off the
deadly garment; <i>but</i> where it is torn off, it tears away the skin,
and, shocking to relate, it either sticks to his limbs, being tried in
vain to be pulled off, or it lays bare his mangled limbs, and his huge
bones. The blood itself hisses, just as when a red hot plate <i>of metal
is</i> dipped in cold water; and it boils with the burning poison. There
is no limit <i>to his misery</i>; the devouring flames prey upon his
entrails, and a livid perspiration flows from his whole body; his
half-burnt sinews also crack; and his marrow being <i>now</i> dissolved
by the subtle poison, lifting his hands towards the stars <i>of
heaven</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">308</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 176-198.</span>
he exclaims, “Daughter of Saturn, satiate thyself with my anguish;
satiate thyself, and look down from on high, O&nbsp;cruel
<i>Goddess</i>, at this <i>my</i> destruction, and glut thy relentless
heart. Or, if I am to be pitied even by an enemy (for an enemy I am to
thee), take away a life insupportable through these dreadful agonies,
hateful, too, <i>to myself</i>, and <i>only</i> destined to trouble.
Death will be a gain to me. It becomes a stepmother to grant such a
favour.</p>

<p>“And was it for this that I subdued Busiris, who polluted the temples

no avail to the Hydra to grow through <i>its own</i> loss, and to
recover double strength? And what besides? When I beheld the Thracian
steeds fattened with human blood, and the mangers filled with mangled
bodies, did I throw them down when <i>thus</i> beheld, and slay both the
master and <i>the horses</i> themselves? <i>And</i> does the carcass of
the Nemean <i>lion</i> lie crushed by these arms? With this neck did I

The unrelenting wife of Jupiter<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_23" id =

I was <i>still</i> unwearied with doing. But <i>now</i> a new calamity
is come upon me, to which resistance can be made neither by valour, nor
by weapons, nor by arms. A&nbsp;consuming flame is pervading the inmost
recesses of my lungs, and is preying on all my limbs. But Eurystheus
<i>still</i> survives. And are there,” says he, “any who can believe
that the Deities exist?”</p>

<p>And <i>then</i>, racked with pain, he ranges along the lofty Œta, no
otherwise than if a tiger should chance to carry the hunting spears
fixed in his body, and the perpetrator of the deed should be taking to
flight. Often might you have beheld him uttering groans, often shrieking
aloud, often striving to tear away the whole of his garments, and
levelling trees, and venting his fury against mountains, or stretching
out his arms towards the heaven of his father. Lo! he espies Lichas,
trembling and lying concealed in a hollow rock, and, as his pain has
summoned together all his fury, he says, “Didst thou, Lichas, bring
<i>this</i> fatal present; and shalt thou be the cause of my death?” He
trembles, and <i>turning</i> pale, is alarmed, and timorously utters
some words of excuse. As he is speaking, and endeavouring to clasp his
knees with his hands, Alcides seizes hold of him, and whirling him round
three or four times, he hurls him into the Eubœan waves, with greater
force than <i>if sent</i> from an engine of war. As he soars aloft in
the aerial breeze he grows hard; and as they say that showers freeze
with the cold winds, <i>and</i> that thence snow is formed, and that
from the snow, revolving <i>in its descent</i>, the soft body is
compressed, and is <i>then</i> made round in many a hailstone,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9_24" id = "tag9_24" href = "#note9_24">24</a> so have
former ages declared, that, hurled through the air by the strong arms
<i>of Hercules</i>, and bereft of blood through fear, and having no
moisture left in him, he was transformed into hard stone. Even to this
day, in the Eubœan sea, a&nbsp;small rock projects to a height, and
<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 227-257.</span>
retains the traces of the human form. This, the sailors are afraid to
tread upon, as though it could feel it; and they call it Lichas.</p>

<p>But thou, the famous offspring of Jupiter, having cut down, trees
which lofty Œta bore, and having raised them for a pile, dost order the
son of Pœas<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_25" id = "tag9_25" href =

arrows which are again to visit<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_26" id =

assistance flames are put beneath the pile; and while the structure is

heap of wood with the skin of the Nemean <i>lion</i>, and dost lie down
with thy neck resting on thy club, with no other countenance than if
thou art lying as a guest crowned with garlands, amid the full cups of
wine.</p>

<p>And now, the flames, prevailing and spreading on every side,
roared,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_27" id = "tag9_27" href =
"#note9_27">27</a> and reached the limbs <i>thus</i> undismayed, and him
who despised them. The Gods were alarmed for <i>this</i> protector of
the earth;<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_28" id = "tag9_28" href =
"#note9_28">28</a> Saturnian Jupiter (for he perceived it) thus
addressed them with joyful voice: “This fear of yours is my own delight,
O&nbsp;ye Gods of heaven, and, with all my heart, I&nbsp;gladly
congratulate myself that I am called the governor and the father of a
grateful people, and that my progeny, too, is secure in your esteem.
For, although this <i>concern</i> is given <i>in return</i> for his
mighty exploits, <i>still</i> I myself am obliged <i>by</i> it. But,
however, that your affectionate breasts may not be alarmed with vain
fears, despise these flames of Œta. He who has conquered all things,
shall conquer the fires which you behold; nor shall he be sensible of
the potency of the flame, but in the part <i>of him</i> which he derived
from his mother. <i>That part of him</i>, which he derived from me, is
immortal, and exempt and secure from death, and to be subdued by no
flames. This, too, when disengaged from earth, I&nbsp;will receive into
the celestial regions, and I trust that this act of mine will be
agreeable to all the Deities. Yet if any one, if any one,
<i>I&nbsp;say</i>, perchance should
<span class = "pagenum">311</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 257-272.</span>
grieve at Hercules being a Divinity, <i>and</i> should be unwilling that
this honour should be conferred on him; still he shall know that he
deserves it to be bestowed <i>on him</i>, and <i>even</i> against his
will, shall approve of&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p><i>To this</i> the Gods assented; his royal spouse, too, seemed to
bear the rest <i>of his remarks</i> with no discontented <i>air</i>, but
only the last words with a countenance of discontent, and to take it
amiss that she was <i>so plainly</i> pointed at. In the mean time,
whatever was liable to be destroyed by flame, Mulciber consumed; and the
figure of Hercules remained, not to be recognized; nor did he have
anything derived from the form of his mother, and he only retained the
traces of <i>immortal</i> Jupiter. And as when a serpent revived, by
throwing off old age with his slough, is wont to be instinct with fresh
life, and to glisten in his new-made scales; so, when the Tirynthian
<i>hero</i> has put off his mortal limbs, he flourishes in his more
æthereal part, and begins to appear more majestic, and to become
venerable in his august dignity. Him the omnipotent Father, taking up
among encircling clouds, bears aloft amid the glittering stars, in his
chariot drawn by <i>its</i> four steeds.</p>

Hercules, leaving the court of Calydon with his wife, proceeded on the
road to the city of Trachyn, in Thessaly, to atone for the accidental
death of Eunomus, and to be absolved from it by Ceyx, who was the king
of that territory. Being obliged to cross the river Evenus, which had
overflowed its banks, the adventure happened with the Centaur Nessus,
which the Poet has here related. We learn from other writers, that after
Nessus had expired, he was buried on Mount Taphiusa; and Strabo informs
us, that his tomb (in which, probably, the ashes of other Centaurs were
deposited) sent forth so offensive a smell, that the Locrians, who were
the inhabitants of the adjacent country, were surnamed the ‘Ozolæ,’ that
is, the ‘ill-smelling,’ or ‘stinking,’ Locrians. Although the river
Evenus lay in the road between Calydon and Trachyn, still it did not run
through the middle of the latter city, as some authors have supposed;
for in such case Hercules would have been more likely to have passed it
by the aid of a bridge or of a boat, than to have recourse to the
assistance of the Centaur Nessus, and to have availed himself of his

Hercules, in lapse of time, becoming tired of Deïanira, by whom he had
one son, named Hyllus, fell in love with Iole, the daughter of Eurytus;
and that prince, refusing to give her to him, he made war upon Œchalia,
and, having slain Eurytus, he bore off his daughter. Upon his return
from that expedition, he sent Lychas for the vestments which he had
occasion to use in a sacrifice which it was his intention to offer.
Deïanira, jealous on account
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 273-274.</span>
of his passion for Iole, sent him either a philtre or love potion, which
unintentionally caused his death, or else a tunic smeared on the inside
with a certain kind of pitch, found near Babylon, which, when thoroughly
warmed, stuck fast to his skin; and this it is, most probably, which has
been termed by poets and historians, the tunic of Nessus. It seems,
however, pretty clear that Hercules fell into a languishing distemper,
without any hopes of recovery, and, probably, in a fit of madness, he
threw Lychas into the sea, which circumstance was made by the poets to
account for the existence there of a rock known by that name.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Proceeding afterwards to Trachyn, he caused Deiänira to hang herself in
despair; and, having consulted the oracle concerning his distemper, he
was ordered to go with his friends to Mount Œta, and there to raise a
funeral pile. He understood the fatal answer, and immediately prepared
to execute its commands. When the pile was ready, Hercules ascended it,
and laid himself down with an air of resignation, on which Philoctetes
kindled the fire, which consumed him. Some, however, of the ancient
authors say, with more probability, that Hercules died at Trachyn, and
that his corpse was burned on Mount Œta. His apotheosis commenced at the
ceremonial of his funeral, and, from the moment of his death, he was
worshipped as a Demigod. Diodorus Siculus says that it was Iolus who
first introduced this worship. It was also said that, as soon as
Philoctetes had applied fire to the pile, it thundered, and the
lightnings descending from heaven immediately consumed Hercules.
A&nbsp;tomb was raised for him on Mount Œta, with an altar, upon which a
bull, a&nbsp;wild boar, and a he-goat were yearly sacrificed in his
honour, at the time of his festival. The Thebans, and, after them, the
other people of Greece, soon followed the example of the Trachinians,
and temples and altars were raised to him in various places, where he
was honoured as a Demigod.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Juno</span>, to be revenged on Alcmena for her
amour with Jupiter, desires Ilithyïa, the Goddess who presides over
births, not to assist her on the occasion of the birth of Hercules.
Lucina complies with her request, and places herself on an altar at the
gate of Alcmena’s abode, where, by a magic spell, she increases her
pains and impedes her delivery. Galanthis, one of her maids, seeing the
Goddess at the door, imagines that she may possibly exercise some bad
influence on her mistress’s labour, and, to make her retire, declares
that Alcmena is already delivered. Upon Ilithyïa withdrawing, Alcmena’s
pains are assuaged, and Hercules is born. The Goddess, to punish
Galanthis for her officiousness, transforms her into a weazel,

and, in his fury, he vented his hatred for the father against his

old age, to whom to relate the achievements of her son attested by
<i>all</i> the world, or to whom <i>to tell</i> her own misfortunes. At
the command of Hercules, Hyllus had received her both into his bed and
his affections, and had filled her womb with a noble offspring. To her,

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
According to Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus, Amphitryon was the son of
Alceus, the son of Perseus, and his wife, Alcmena, was the daughter of
Electryon, also the son of Perseus; and thus they were cousins. When
their marriage was about to take place, an unforeseen accident prevented
it. Electryon, who was king of Mycenæ, being obliged to revenge the
death of his children, whom the sons of Taphius, king of the Teleboans,
had killed in combat, returned victorious, and brought back with him his
flocks, which he had recovered from Taphius. Amphitryon, who went to
meet his uncle, to congratulate him upon the success of his expedition,
throwing his club at a cow, which happened to stray from the herd,
unfortunately killed him. This accidental homicide lost him the kingdom
of Mycenæ, which was to have formed the dower of Alcmena. Sthenelus, the
brother of Electryon, taking advantage of the public indignation, which
was the result of the accident, drove Amphitryon out of the country of
Argos, and made himself master of his brother’s dominions, which he
left, at his death, to his son Eurystheus, the inveterate persecutor of
Hercules.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Amphitryon, obliged to retire to Thebes, was there absolved by Creon;
but when, as he thought, he was about to receive the hand of Alcmena,
who accompanied him to the court of that prince, she declared that, not
being satisfied with the revenge which her father had taken on the
Teleboans, she would consent to be the prize of him who would undertake
to declare war against them. Amphitryon accepted these conditions, and,
forming an alliance with Creon, Cephalus, and some other princes, made a
descent upon the islands which the enemy possessed, and, making himself
master of them, bestowed one of them on his ally, Cephalus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It was during this war that Hercules came into the world; and whether
Amphitryon had secretly consummated his marriage before his departure,
or whether he had returned privately to Thebes, or to Tirynthus, where
Hercules was said to have been born, it was published, that Jupiter, to
deceive Alcmena, had taken the form of her husband, and was the father
of the infant Hercules. If this is not the true explanation of the
story, it may have been invented to conceal some intrigue in which
Alcmena was detected; or, in process of time, to account for the
extraordinary strength and valour of Hercules, it may have been said
that Jupiter, and not Amphitryon, was the father of Hercules. Indeed, we
find Seneca, in one of his Tragedies, putting these words into the mouth
of Hercules:&mdash; ‘Whether all that has been said upon this subject be
held as undoubted truth, or whether it proves to be but a fable, and
that my father was, after all, in reality, but a mortal; my mother’s
fault is sufficiently effaced by my valour, and I have merit sufficient
to have had Jupiter for my father.’ The more readily, perhaps, to
account for the transcendent strength and prowess of Hercules, the story
was invented, that Jupiter made the night on which he was received by
Alcmena under the form of Amphitryon, as long as three, or, according to
Plautus, Hyginus, and Seneca, nine nights. Some writers say that Alcmena
brought forth twins, one of which, Iphiclus, was the son of Amphitryon,
while Hercules had Jupiter for his father.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<p class = "explanation">
With respect to the metamorphosis of Galanthis, it is but a little
episode here introduced by Ovid, to give greater plausibility to the
other part of the story. It most probably originated in the resemblance
of the names of that slave to that of the weazel, which the Greeks
called <span class = "greek" title = "galê">γαλῆ</span>. Ælian, indeed,
tells us that the Thebans paid honour to that animal, because it had
helped Alcmena in her labour. The more ancient poets also added, that
Juno retarded the birth of Hercules till the mother of Eurystheus was
delivered, which was the cause of his being the subject of that king;
though others state that this came to pass by the command of the oracle
of Delphi. This king of Mycenæ having ordered him to rid Greece of the
numerous robbers and wild beasts that infested it, it is most probable
that, as we learn from Dionysius of Halicarnassus, he performed this
service at the head of the troops of Eurystheus. If this is the case,
the persecutions which the poets have ascribed to the jealousy of Juno,
really originated either in the policy or the jealousy of the court of
Mycenæ.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
As Ovid has here cursorily taken notice of the labours of Hercules, we
may observe, that it is very probable that his history is embellished
with the pretended adventures of many persons who bore his name, and,
perhaps, with those of others besides. Cicero, in his ‘Treatise on the
Nature of the Gods,’ mentions six persons who bore the name of Hercules;
and possibly, after a minute examination, a&nbsp;much greater number
might be reckoned, many nations of antiquity having given the name to
such great men of their own as had rendered themselves famous by their
actions. Thus, we find one in Egypt in the time of Osiris, in Phœnicia,
among the Gauls, in Spain, and in other countries. Confining ourselves
to the Grecian Hercules, surnamed Alcides, we find that his exploits
have generally been sung of by the poets, under the name of the Twelve
Labours; but, on entering into the detail of them, we find them much
more numerous. Killing some serpents in his youth, it was published, not
only that he had done so, but that they had been sent by Juno for the
purpose of destroying him. The forest of Nemea serving as a retreat for
a great number of lions that ravaged the country, Hercules hunted them,
and, killing the most furious of them, always wore his skin.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Several thieves, having made the neighbourhood of Lake Stymphalus, in
Arcadia, their resort, he freed the country of them; the nails and wings
which the poets gave them, in representing them as birds, being typical
of their voracity and activity. The marshes of Lerna, near Argos, were
infested by great numbers of serpents, which, as fast as they were
destroyed, were replaced by new swarms; draining the marshes, and,
probably, setting fire to the adjacent thickets or jungles, he destroyed
these pestilent reptiles, on which it was fabled that he had destroyed
the Hydra of Lerna, with its heads, which grew as fast as they were cut
off. The forest of Erymanthus was full of wild boars, which laid waste
all the neighbouring country: he destroyed them all, and brought one
with him to the court of Eurystheus, of a size so monstrous, that the
king was alarmed on seeing it, and was obliged to run and hide
himself.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The stables of Augeas, king of Elis, were so filled with manure, by
reason of the great quantity of oxen that he kept, that Hercules being
<span class = "pagenum">317</span>
called upon to cleanse them, employed his engineering skill in bringing
the river Alpheus through them. Having pursued a hind for a whole year,
which Eurystheus had commanded him to take, it was circulated, probably
on account of her untiring swiftness, that she had feet of brass. The
river Acheloüs having overflowed the adjacent country, he raised banks
to it, as already mentioned. Theseus was a prisoner in Epirus, where he
had been with Pirithous, to bring away the daughter of Aidoneus.
Hercules delivered him; and that was the foundation of the Fable which
said that he had gone down to Hades, or Hell. In the cavern of Tænarus
there was a monstrous serpent; this he was ordered to kill, and,
probably, this gave rise to the story of Cerberus being chained by him.
Pelias having been killed by his daughters, his son Acastus pursued them
to the court of Admetus, who, refusing to deliver up Alcestis, of whom
he was enamoured, was taken prisoner in an engagement, and was delivered
by that princess, who herself offered to be his ransom. Hercules being
then in Thessaly, he took her away from Acastus, who was about to put
her to death, and returned her to Admetus. This, probably, was the
foundation of the fable which stated, that he had recovered her from the
Infernal Regions, after having vanquished death, and bound him in
chains.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Amazons were a nation of great celebrity in the time of Hercules,
and their frequent victories had rendered them very formidable to their
neighbours. Eurystheus ordered him to go and bring away the girdle of
Hippolyta, or, in other words, to make war upon them, and to pillage
their treasures. Embarking on the Euxine Sea, Hercules arrived on the
banks of the Thermodon, and, giving battle to the female warriors,
defeated them; killing some, and putting the rest to flight. He took
Antiope, or Hippolyta, prisoner, whom he gave to Theseus; but her
sister, Menalippa, redeemed herself by giving up the famous girdle, or,
in other words, by paying a large ransom. It is very probable, that in
that expedition, he slew Diomedes, the barbarous king of Thrace, and
brought away his mares, which were said to have been fed by him on human
flesh. In returning by way of Thessaly, he embarked in the expedition of
the Argonauts; but, leaving them soon afterwards, he went to Troy, and
delivered Hesione from the monster which was to have devoured her; but
not receiving from Laomedon, the king, the recompense which had been
promised him, he killed that prince, sacked the city, and brought away
Hesione, whom he gave to Telamon, who had accompanied him on the
expedition.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
This is probably the extent of the labours of Hercules in Greece,
Thrace, and Phrygia. The poets have made him engage in many other
laborious undertakings in distant countries, which most probably ought
not to be attributed to the Grecian Hercules. Among other stories told
of him, it is said, that having set out to fight with Geryon, the king
of Spain, he was so much incommoded by the heat of the sun, that his
wrath was excited against the luminary, and he fired his arrows at it,
on which, the Sun, struck with admiration at his spirited conduct, made
him a present of a golden goblet. After this, embarking and arriving in
Spain, he defeated Geryon, a&nbsp;prince who was famed for having three
heads, which probably either meant that he reigned over the three
Balearic islands of Maiorca, Minorca, and Iviza, or else that
<span class = "pagenum">318</span>
Hercules defeated three princes who were strictly allied. Having thence
passed the straits of Gibraltar to go over to Africa, he fought with the
Giant Antæus, who sought to oppose his landing. That prince was said to
be a son of the Earth, and was reported to recover fresh strength every
time he was thrown on the ground; consequently, Hercules was obliged to
hold him in his arms, till he had squeezed him to death. The solution of
this fable is most probably that Antæus, always finding succour in a
country where he was known as a powerful monarch, Hercules took measures
to deprive him of aid, by engaging him in a sea fight, and thereby
defeated him, without much trouble, as well as the Pygmies, who were
probably some African tribes of stunted stature, who came to his
assistance.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Hercules, returning from these two expeditions, passed through Gaul with
the herds of Geryon, and went into Italy, where Cacus, a&nbsp;celebrated
robber, who had made the caverns of Mount Aventine his haunts, having
stolen some of his oxen, he, with the assistance, according to Dionysius
of Halicarnassus, of Evander and Faunus, destroyed him, and shared his
spoils with his allies. In his journey from Africa, Hercules delivered
Atlas from the enmity of Busiris, the tyrant of Egypt, whom he killed;
and gave such good advice to the Mauritanian king, that it was said that
he supported the heavens for some time on his own shoulders, to relieve
those of Atlas. The latter, by way of acknowledgment of his services,
made him a present of several fine sheep, or rather, according to
Diodorus Siculus, of some orange and lemon trees, which he carried with
him into Greece. These were represented as the golden apples watched by
a dragon in the garden of the Hesperides. As the ocean there terminated
the scene of his conquests, he was said to have raised two pillars on
those shores, to signify the fact of his having been there, and the
impossibility of proceeding any further.</p>

The deliverance of Prometheus, as already mentioned; the death of the

it crushed twenty-four men to death; that of Eryx, king of Sicily, whom
he killed with a blow of the cestus, for refusing to deliver to him the
oxen which he had stolen; the combat with Cycnus, which was terminated
by a peal of thunder, which separated the combatants; another combat
against the Giants in Gaul, during which, as it was said, Jupiter rained

Hercules, besides many more stories, which, if diligently collected,

The foregoing remarks on the history of Hercules, give us an insight
into the ideas which, based upon the explanations given by the authors
of antiquity, the Abbè Banier, one of the most accomplished scholars of
his age, entertained on this subject. We will conclude with some very
able and instructive remarks on this mythus, which we extract from Mr.
Keightley’s Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy. He says&mdash;</p>

<p class = "explanation">
“Various theories have been formed respecting the mythus of Hercules. It
is evidently one of very remote antiquity, long perhaps, anterior to the
<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
times of Homer. We confess that we cannot see any very valid reason for
supposing no such real personage to have existed; for it will, perhaps,
be found that mythology not unfrequently prefers to absolute fiction,
the assuming of some real historic character, and making it the object
of the marvels devised by lively and exuberant imagination, in order
thereby to obtain more ready credence for the strange events which it
creates. Such, then, may the real Hercules have
been,&mdash;a&nbsp;Dorian, a&nbsp;Theban, or an Argive hero, whose feats
of strength lived in the traditions of the people, and whom national
vanity raised to the rank of a son of Zeus [Jupiter], and poetic fancy,
as geographic knowledge extended, sent on journies throughout the known
world, and accumulated in his person the fabled exploits of similar
heroes of other regions.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
“We may perceive, by the twelve tasks, that the astronomical theory was
applied to the mythus of the hero, and that he was regarded as a
personification of the Sun, which passes through the twelve signs of the
Zodiac. This, probably, took place during the Alexandrian period. Some
resemblance between his attributes and those of the Deity, with whom the
Egyptian priests were pleased to identify him, may have given occasion
to this notion; and he also bore some similitude to the God whom the
Phœnicians chiefly worshipped, and who, it is probable, was the Sun. But
we must steadily bear in mind, that Hercules was a hero in the popular
legend long before any intercourse was opened between Greece and Egypt;
and that, however (which is certainly not very likely) a&nbsp;God might
be introduced from Phœnicia, the same could hardly be the case with a
popular hero.&mdash;A&nbsp;very ingenious theory on the mythus of
Hercules is given by Buttmann (Mythologus, vol.&nbsp;i., p. 246). Though
acknowledging that Perseus, Theseus, and Hercules may have been real
persons, he is disposed, from an attentive consideration of all the
circumstances in the mythus of the last, to regard him as one of those
poetical persons or personifications, who, as he says, have obtained
such firm footing in the dark periods of antiquity, as to have acquired
the complete air of historic personages.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
“In his view of the life of Hercules, it is a mythus of extreme
antiquity and great beauty, setting forth the ideal of human perfection,
consecrated to the weal of mankind, or rather, in its original form, to
that of his own nation. This perfection, according to the ideas of the
heroic age, consists in the greatest bodily strength, united with the
advantages of mind and soul recognised by that age. Such a hero is, he
says, a&nbsp;man; but these noble qualities in him are of divine origin.
He is, therefore, the son of the king of the Gods by a mortal mother. To
render his perfection the more manifest, the Poet makes him to have a
twin brother, the child of a mortal sire. As virtue is not to be
learned, Hercules exhibits his strength and courage in infancy; he
strangles the snakes, which fills his brother with terror. The character
of the hero throughout life, as that of the avenger of injustice and
punisher of evil, must exhibit itself in the boy as the wild instinct of
nature; and the mythus makes him kill his tutor Linus with a blow of the
lyre. When sent away by Amphitryon, he prepares himself, in the
stillness and solitude of the shepherd’s life, by feats of strength and
courage, for his future task of purifying the earth of violence.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">320</span>
<p class = "explanation">
“&mdash;The number of tasks may not originally have been twelve, though
most accounts agree in that number, but they were all of a nature
agreeable to the ideas of an heroic age&mdash;the destruction of
monsters, and bringing home to his own country the valuable productions
of other regions. These are, however, regarded by Buttmann as being
chiefly allegorical. The Hydra, for instance, he takes to have been
meant to represent the evils of democratic anarchy, with its numerous
heads, against which, though one may not be able to effect anything, yet
the union of even two may suffice to become dominant over&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
“The toils of the hero conclude with the greatest and most rare of all
in the heroic age&mdash;the conquest over death. This is represented by
his descent into the under world, and dragging Cerberus to light is a
proof of his victory. In the old mythus, he was made to engage with and
wound Hades; and the Alcestis of Euripides exhibits him in conflict with
Death. But virtue, to be a useful example, must occasionally succumb to
human weakness in the power of the evil principle. Hence, Hercules falls
into fits of madness, sent on him by Hera [Juno]; and hence&mdash;he
becomes the willing slave of Omphale, the fair queen of Lydia, and
changes his club and lion’s skin for the distaff and the female
robe.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
“The mythus concludes most nobly with the assumption of the hero into
Olympus. His protecting Deity abandons him to the power of his
persevering enemy; his mortal part is consumed by fire, the fiercest of
elements; his shade (<span class = "greek" title =
"eidôlon">εἴδωλον</span>), like those of other men, descends to the
realms of Hades, while the divine portion himself (<span class = "greek"
title = "autos">αὐτὸς</span>) mounts from the pyre in a thunder-cloud,
and the object of Hera’s persecution being now accomplished, espouses
youth, the daughter of his reconciled foe.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
“Muller (Dorians, vol. i. part ii. ch. 11, 12) is also disposed to view
in Hercules a personification of the highest powers of man in the heroic
age. He regards him as having been the national hero of the Dorian race,
and appropriates to him all the exploits of the hero in Thessaly,
Ætolia, and Epirus, which last place he supposes to have been the
original scene of the Geryoneia, which was afterwards transformed to the
western stream of the ocean. He thinks, however, that the Argives had an
ancient hero of perhaps the same name, to whom the Peloponnesus
adventures belong, and whom the Dorians combined with their own hero.
The servitude to Eurystheus, and the enmity of Hera, he looks on as
inventions of the Dorians to justify their own invasion of the
Peloponnesus. This critic also proves that the Theban Hercules had
nothing to do with the Gods and traditions of the Cadmeians; and he
thinks that it was the Dorian Heracleides who introduced the knowledge
of him into Thebes, or that he came from Delphi with the worship of
Apollo, a&nbsp;Deity with whom, as the tutelar God of the Dorians, he
supposes their national hero to have been closely connected.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">The</span> Nymph Lotis, pursued by Priapus, in
her flight, is changed into a tree. Dryope, going to sacrifice to the
Naiads at the same spot, and ignorant of the circumstance, breaks a
branch off the tree for her child, which she is carrying with her, and
is subjected to a similar transformation. While Iole is relating these
circumstances to Alcmena, she is surprised to see her brother Iolaüs
restored to youth. The Poet here introduces the prediction of Themis
concerning the children of Calirrhoë.</p>

<p>Thus she said; and, moved by the remembrance of her old servant, she
heaved a deep sigh. Her daughter-in-law<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_36"
id = "tag9_36" href = "#note9_36">36</a> addressed her, thus grieving.
“Even her form being taken away from one that was an alien to thy blood,
affects thee, O&nbsp;mother. What if I were to relate to thee the
wondrous fate of my own sister? although tears and sorrow hinder me, and
forbid me to speak. Dryope, the most remarkable for her beauty of the
Œchalian maids, was the only daughter of her mother (<i>for</i> my
father had me by another <i>wife</i>). Deprived of her virginity, and
having suffered violence from the God that owns Delphi and Delos,
Andræmon married her, and he was esteemed fortunate in his wife.</p>

<p>“There is a lake that gives the appearance of a sloping shore, by its
shelving border; groves of myrtle crown the upper part. Hither did
Dryope come, unsuspecting of her fate; and, that thou mayst be the more
indignant <i>at her lot</i>, she was about to offer garlands to the
Nymphs. In her bosom, too, she was bearing her son, who had not yet
completed his first year, a&nbsp;pleasing burden; and she was nursing
him, with the help of <i>her</i> warm milk. Not far from the lake was
blooming a watery lotus that vied with the Tyrian tints, in hope of
<i>future</i> berries. Dryope had plucked thence some flowers, which she
might give as playthings to her child; and I, too, was just on the point
of doing the same; for I was present. I&nbsp;saw bloody drops fall from
the flower, and the boughs shake with a tremulous quivering; for, as the
swains say, now, at length, too late <i>in their information</i>, the
Nymph Lotis, flying from the lust of Priapus,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9_37" id = "tag9_37" href = "#note9_37">37</a> had transferred her
changed form into this <i>plant</i>, her name being <i>still</i>
preserved.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 349-383.</span>

<p>“Of this my sister was ignorant. When, in her alarm, she is
endeavouring to retire and to depart, having adored the Nymphs, her feet
are held fast by a root. She strives hard to tear them up, but she moves
nothing except her upper parts. From below, a&nbsp;bark slowly grows up,
and, by degrees, it envelopes the whole of her groin. When she sees
this, endeavouring to tear her hair with her hands, she fills her hand
with leaves, <i>for</i> leaves are covering all her head. But the boy
Amphissos (for his grandfather Eurytus gave him this name) feels his
mother’s breast growing hard; nor does the milky stream follow upon his
sucking. I&nbsp;was a spectator of thy cruel destiny, and I could give
thee no help, my sister; and <i>yet</i>, as long as I could,
I&nbsp;delayed the growing trunk and branches by embracing them; and,
I&nbsp;confess it, I&nbsp;was desirous to be hidden beneath the same
bark. Behold! her husband Andræmon and her most wretched father<a class
= "tag" name = "tag9_38" id = "tag9_38" href = "#note9_38">38</a>
appear, and inquire for Dryope: on their inquiring for Dryope,
I&nbsp;show them the lotus. They give kisses to the wood <i>still</i>
warm <i>with life</i>, and, extended <i>on the ground</i>, they cling to
the roots of their own tree. <i>And</i> now, dear sister, thou hadst
nothing except thy face, that was not tree. Tears drop upon the leaves
made out of thy changed body; and, while she can, and <i>while</i> her
mouth gives passage to her voice, she pours forth such complaints <i>as
these</i> into the air:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘If any credit <i>is to be given</i> to the wretched, I&nbsp;swear
by the Deities that I merited not this cruel usage. I&nbsp;suffer
punishment without a crime. I&nbsp;lived in innocence; if I am speaking
false, withered away, may I lose the leaves which I bear, and, cut down
with axes, may I be burnt. Yet take this infant away from the branches
of his mother, and give him to his nurse; and often, beneath my tree,
make him drink milk, and beneath my tree let him play; and, when he
shall be able to speak, make him salute his mother, and let him in
sadness say, ‘Beneath this trunk is my mother concealed.’ Yet let him
dread the ponds, and let him not pluck flowers from the trees; and let
him think that all shrubs are the bodies of Goddesses. Farewell, dear
husband; and thou, sister; and, <i>thou</i> my father; in whom, if there
is any affection <i>towards me</i>, protect my branches from the wounds
of the sharp pruning-knife,
<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 383-410.</span>
<i>and</i> from the bite of the cattle. And since it is not allowed me
to bend down towards you, stretch your limbs up hither, and come near
for my kisses, while they can <i>still</i> be reached, and lift up my
little son. More I cannot say. For the soft bark is now creeping along
my white neck, and I am being enveloped at the top of my head. Remove
your hands from my eyes;<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_39" id = "tag9_39"
href = "#note9_39">39</a> <i>and</i>, without your help, let the bark,
closing over them, cover my dying eyes.’ Her mouth ceased at once to
speak, at once to exist; and long after her body was changed, were her
newly formed branches <i>still</i> warm.”</p>

<p>And <i>now</i>, while Iole was relating the wretched fate of her
sister, and while Alcmena was drying away the tears of the daughter of
Eurytus, with her fingers applied <i>to her face</i>, and still she
herself was weeping, a&nbsp;novel event hushed all their sorrow; for
Iolaüs<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_40" id = "tag9_40" href =
"#note9_40">40</a> stood at the lofty threshold, almost a boy
<i>again</i>, and covering his cheeks with a down almost imperceptible,
having his visage changed to <i>that of</i> the first years <i>of
manhood</i>. Hebe, the daughter of Juno had granted him this favour,
overcome by the solicitations of her husband. When she was about to
swear that she would hereafter grant such favours to no one, Themis did
not allow her. “For now,” said she, “Thebes is commencing civil
warfare,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_41" id = "tag9_41" href =
"#note9_41">41</a> and Capaneus will not be able to be overcome, except
by Jupiter, and the two brothers will engage in bloody combat, and the
earth dividing, the prophet <i>Amphiaraüs</i> will see his
<i>destined</i> shades, while he still lives;<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9_42" id = "tag9_42" href = "#note9_42">42</a> and the son avenging
one parent, by <i>the death of</i> the <i>other</i> parent, will be
dutiful and wicked in the same action; and confounded by his
misfortunes, deprived both of his reason and of his home, he will be
persecuted both by the features of the
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 410-424.</span>
Eumenides, and by the ghost of his mother; until his wife shall call
upon him for the fatal gold, and the Phegeïan sword shall stab the side
of their kinsman. Then, at last, shall Calirrhoë, the daughter of
Acheloüs, suppliantly ask of mighty Jupiter these years <i>of youth</i>
for her infant sons. Jupiter, concerned <i>for them</i>, will prescribe
for them the <i>peculiar</i> gift of her who is <i>both</i> his
step-daughter and his daughter-in-law,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_43"
id = "tag9_43" href = "#note9_43">43</a> and will make them men in their
years of childhood.”</p>

<p>When Themis, foreseeing the future, had said these words with
prophetic voice, the Gods above murmured in varying discourse; and the
complaint was,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_44" id = "tag9_44" href =
"#note9_44">44</a> why it might not be allowed others to grant the same
gifts. <i>Aurora</i>, the daughter of Pallas, complained of the aged
years of her husband; the gentle Ceres complained that Iäsion<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9_45" id = "tag9_45" href = "#note9_45">45</a> was
growing grey; Mulciber demanded for Ericthonius a life to live over
again; a&nbsp;concern for the future influenced Venus, too, and she made
an offer to renew the years of Anchises.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The adventure of Dryope is one of those narratives which have no
connexion with the main story which the Poet is relating, and, if really
founded on fact, it would almost baffle any attempt to guess at its
origin. It is, most probably, built entirely upon the name of the damsel
who was said to have met with the untimely and unnatural fate so well
depicted by the Poet.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The name of Dryope comes, very probably, from the Greek word <span class
= "greek" title = "Drus">Δρῦς</span>, ‘an oak,’ which tree has a
considerable resemblance to the lotus tree. If we seek for an historical
solution, perhaps Dryope was punished for attempting to profane a tree
consecrated to the Gods, a&nbsp;crime of which Erisicthon was guilty,
and for which he was so signally punished. All the particulars that we
know of Dryope are, that she was the daughter of Eurytus, and the sister
of Iole; and that she was the wife of Andræmon.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid says, that while Iole was relating this adventure to Alcmena,
Iolaüs, who, according to some, was the son of Hercules, by Hebe, after
his apotheosis, and, according to others, was the son of Iphiclus, the
brother of Hercules, became young, at the intercession of that Goddess,
who had
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 425-426.</span>
appeased Juno. This was, probably, no other than a method of accounting
for the great age to which and individual of the name of Iolaüs had
lived.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid then passes on to the surprising change in the children of
Calirrhoë, the outline of which the story may be thus
explained:&mdash;Amphiaraüs, foreseeing, (by the aid of the prophetic
art, as we learn from Homer, Diodorus Siculus, Pliny and Statius), that
the civil wars of Thebes, his native country, would prove fatal to him,
retired from the court of Adrastus, King of Argos, whose sister he had
married, to conceal himself in some place of safety. The Argives, to
whom the oracle had declared, that Thebes could not be taken unless they
had Amphiaraüs with their troops, searched for him in every direction;
but their labour would have been in vain, if Eriphyle, his wife, gained
by a necklace of great value, which her brother Adrastus gave her, had
not discovered where he was. Discovered in his retreat, Amphiaraüs
accompanied the Argives, and while, according to the rules of the
soothsaying art, he was observing a flight of birds, in order to derive
an augury from it, his horses fell down a precipice, and he lost his
life. Statius and other writers, to describe this event in a poetical
manner, say that the earth opened and swallowed up him and his
chariot.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Amphiaraüs had engaged his son Alcmæon, in case he lost his life in the
war, to kill Eriphyle; which injunction he performed as soon as he heard
of the death of his father. Alcmæon, going to the court of Phegeus, to
receive expiation for his crime, and to deliver himself from the
persecution of the Furies, or, in other words, by the ceremonial of
expiation, to tranquillize his troubled conscience, that prince received
him with kindness, and gave him his daughter Alphesibæa in marriage.
Alcmæon made her a present of his mother Eriphyle’s necklace; but,
having afterwards repudiated her to marry Calirrhoë, or Arsinoë, the
daughter of Acheloüs, he went to demand the necklace from his
brothers-in-law, who assassinated him. Amphiterus and Acarnanus, who
were his sons by Calirrhoë, revenged the death of their father when they
were very young; and this it is, possibly, which is meant by the Poet
when he says that the Goddess Hebe augmented the number of their years,
the purpose being, to put them speedily in a position to enable them to
avenge the death of their father.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Thus we see, that Iolaüs was, like Æson, who also renewed his youth,
a&nbsp;person who, in his old age, gave marks of unusual vigour; while
in Amphiterus and Arcananus, to whom Hebe added years, are depicted two
young men, who, by a deed of blood, exacted retribution for the death of
their father, at a time when they were in general only looked upon as
mere children.</p>

<span class = "linenum">ix. 428-457.</span>
is increasing by their <i>various</i> interests, until Jupiter opens his
mouth, and says, “O, if you have any regard for me, to what rash steps
are you proceeding? Does any one <i>of you</i> seem to himself so
powerful as to overcome even the Fates? By the Fates has Iolaüs returned
to those years which he has spent; by the Fates ought the sons of
Calirrhoë to become young men, <i>and</i> not by ambition or by dint of
arms. And do you, too, endure this as well with more contented mind,
<i>for</i> even me do the Fates govern; could I but change them,
declining years should not be making my <i>son</i> Æacus to bend
<i>beneath them</i>; and Rhadamanthus should have the everlasting flower
of age, together with my <i>son</i>, Minos, who is <i>now</i> looked
down upon on account of the grievous weight of old age, and does not
reign with the dignity with which once <i>he did</i>.”</p>

<p>The words of Jupiter influenced the Divinities; and no one continued
to complain when they saw Rhadamanthus and Æacus, and Minos, weary with
years; <i>Minos</i>, who, when he was in the prime of life, had alarmed
great nations with his very name. Then, <i>however</i>, he was enfeebled
by age, and was alarmed by Miletus, the son of Deione,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag9_47" id = "tag9_47" href = "#note9_47">47</a> exulting in
the strength of youth, and in Phœbus as his sire; and <i>though</i>
believing that he was aiming at his kingdom, still he did not dare to
drive him away from his native home. Of thy own accord, Miletus, thou
didst fly, and in the swift ship thou didst pass over the Ægean waters,
and in the land of Asia didst build a city, bearing the name of its
founder. Here Cyane, the daughter of <i>the river</i> Mæander, that so
often returns to the same place, while she was following the windings of
her father’s bank, of a body excelling in beauty, being known by thee,
brought forth a double offspring, Byblis, with Caunus, <i>her
brother</i>.</p>

<p>Byblis is an example that damsels <i>only</i> ought to love what it
is allowed them <i>to love</i>; Byblis, seized with a passion for her
brother, the descendant of Apollo, loved him not as a sister
<i>loves</i> a brother, nor in such manner as she ought. At first,
indeed, she understands nothing of the flame, and she
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 457-488.</span>
does not think<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_48" id = "tag9_48" href =
"#note9_48">48</a> that she is doing wrong in so often giving him
kisses, <i>and</i> in throwing her arms round the neck of her brother;
and for a long time she <i>herself</i> is deceived, by this resemblance
of natural affection. By degrees this affection degenerates, and decked
out, she comes to see her brother, and is too anxious to appear
beautiful; and if there is any woman there more beautiful, she envies
her. But, as yet she is not fully discovered to herself, and under that
flame conceives no wishes; but still, inwardly she is agitated. At one
moment she calls him sweetheart,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_49" id =
"tag9_49" href = "#note9_49">49</a> at another, she hates the mention of
his relationship; and now she prefers that he should call her Byblis,
rather than sister. Still, while awake, she does not dare admit any
criminal hopes into her mind; <i>but</i> when dissolved in soft sleep,
she often sees the <i>object</i> which she is in love with. She seems to
be even embracing her brother, and she blushes, though she is lying
buried in sleep. Slumber departs; for a long time she is silent, and she
recalls to <i>memory</i> the appearance of her dream, and thus she
speaks with wavering mind:</p>

<p>“Ah, wretched me! What means this vision of the silent night? How far
am I from wishing it real. Why have I seen this dream? He is, indeed,
beautiful, even to envious eyes. He pleases me, too; and were he not my
brother, I&nbsp;could love him, and he would be worthy of me. But it is
my misfortune that I am his sister. So long as I strive, while awake, to
commit no such <i>attempt</i>, let sleep often return with the like
appearance. No witness is there in sleep; and yet there is the
resemblance of the delight. O&nbsp;Venus and winged Cupid, together with
thy voluptuous mother, how great the joys I experienced! how substantial
the transport which affected me! How I lay dissolved <i>in delight</i>
throughout my whole marrow! How pleasing to remember it; although
short-lived was that pleasure, and the night sped onward rapidly, and
was envious of my attempts <i>at bliss</i>. Oh, could I only be united
<i>to thee</i>, by changing my name, how happily, Caunus, could I become
the daughter-in-law of thy father! how
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 488-516.</span>
happily, Caunus, couldst thou become the son-in-law of my father! O,
that the Gods would grant that all things were in common with us, except
our ancestors. Would that thou wast more nobly born than myself. For
this reason then, most beauteous one, thou wilt make some stranger, whom
I know not, a&nbsp;mother; but to me, who have unhappily got the same
parents as thyself, thou wilt be nothing <i>more</i> than a brother.
That <i>tie</i> alone we shall have, which bars all else. What, then, do
my visions avail me? And what weight have dreams? And do dreams have any
weight? The Gods <i>fare</i> better; for the Gods have their own sisters
<i>in marriage</i>. Thus Saturn married Ops,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9_50" id = "tag9_50" href = "#note9_50">50</a> related to him by
blood; Ocean Tethys, the ruler of Olympus Juno. The Gods above have
their privileges. Why do I attempt to reduce human customs to the rule
of divine ordinances, and those so different? Either this forbidden
flame shall be expelled from my heart, or if I cannot effect that,
I&nbsp;pray that I may first perish, and that when dead I may be laid
out on my bed, and that my brother may give me kisses as I lie. And
besides, this matter requires the inclination of us both; suppose it
pleases me; to him it will seem to be a crime. But the sons of Æolus<a
class = "tag" name = "tag9_51" id = "tag9_51" href = "#note9_51">51</a>
did not shun the embraces of their sisters. But whence have I known of
these? Why have I furnished myself with these precedents? Whither am I
hurried onward? Far hence begone, ye lawless flames! and let not my
brother be loved by me, but as it is lawful for a sister <i>to love
him</i>. But yet, if he had been first seized with a passion for me,
perhaps I might have indulged his desires. Am I then, myself, to court
him, whom I would not have rejected, had he courted me? And canst thou
speak out? And canst thou confess it? Love will compel me. I&nbsp;can.
Or if shame shall restrain my lips, a&nbsp;private letter shall confess
the latent flame.”</p>

<p>This thought pleases her, this determines her wavering
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 516-546.</span>
mind. She raises herself on her side, and leaning on her left elbow, she
says, “He shall see it; let me confess my frantic passion. Ah, wretched
me! How am I degrading myself! What flame is my mind <i>now</i>
kindling!” And <i>then</i>, with trembling hand, she puts together the
words well weighed. Her right hand holds the iron <i>pen</i>, the other,
clean wax tablets.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_52" id = "tag9_52" href
= "#note9_52">52</a> She begins, and <i>then</i> she hesitates; she
writes, and <i>then</i> corrects what is written; she marks, and
<i>then</i> scratches out; she alters, and condemns, and approves; and
one while she throws them down when taken up, and at another time, she
takes them up again, when thrown aside. What she would have, she knows
not. Whatever she seems on the point of doing, is not to her taste. In
her features are assurance mingled with shame. <i>The word</i> ‘sister’
is written; it seems <i>as well</i> to efface <i>the word</i> ‘sister,’
and <i>then</i> to write such words as these upon the smoothed wax: “Thy
lover wishes thee that health which she, herself, is not to enjoy,
unless thou shalt grant it. I&nbsp;am ashamed! Oh, I&nbsp;am ashamed to
disclose my name! and shouldst thou inquire what it is I wish; without
my name<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_53" id = "tag9_53" href =
"#note9_53">53</a> could I wish my cause to be pleaded, and that I might
not be known as Byblis, until the hopes of <i>enjoying</i> my desires
were realized. There might have been as a proof to thee of my wounded
heart, my <i>pale</i> complexion, my falling away, my <i>downcast</i>
looks, and my eyes often wet with tears, sighs, too, fetched without any
seeming cause; frequent embraces too, and kisses, which, if perchance
thou didst observe, could not be deemed to be those of a sister. Still
I, myself, though I had a grievous wound in my soul, <i>and</i> although
there was a raging fire within, have done everything, as the Gods are my
witnesses, that at last I might be cured; and long, in my wretchedness,
have I struggled to escape the ruthless weapon of Cupid; and I have
endured more hardships than thou wouldst believe that a maiden could
endure.</p>

<p>“Vanquished <i>at length</i>, I am forced to own <i>my passion</i>;
and with timorous prayers, to entreat thy aid. Thou alone canst
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 546-579.</span>
save, thou destroy, one who loves thee. Choose which thou wilt do. She
is not thy enemy who begs this; but one who, though most nearly
connected with thee, desires to be still more closely connected, and to
be united to thee in a nearer tie. Let aged men be acquainted with
ordinances, and make inquiry what is lawful, and what is wicked, and
what is proper; and let them employ themselves in considering the laws.
A&nbsp;passion that dares all consequences is suited to our years. As
yet, we know not what is lawful, and we believe that all things are
lawful, and <i>so</i> follow the example of the great Gods. Neither a
severe father, nor regard for character, nor fear, shall restrain us,
<i>if</i> only the cause for fearing is removed. Under a brother’s name
will we conceal our stolen joys <i>so</i> sweet. I&nbsp;have the liberty
of conversing with thee in private; and <i>even</i> before others do we
give embraces, and exchange kisses. How little is it that is wanting! do
have pity on the love of her who confesses it, and who would not confess
it, did not extreme passion compel her; and merit not to be inscribed on
my tomb as the cause <i>of my death</i>.”</p>

<p>The filled tablets fall short for her hand, as it vainly inscribes
such words as these, and the last line is placed in the margin.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag9_54" id = "tag9_54" href = "#note9_54">54</a> At
once she seals up her own condemnation, with the impress of a signet,
which she wets with her tears, <i>for</i> the moisture has deserted her
tongue. Filled with shame, she <i>then</i> calls one of her male
domestics, and gently addressing him in timorous tones, she said, “Carry
these, most trusty one, to my,” and, after a long pause, she added,
“brother.” While she was delivering them, the tablets, slipping from her
hands, fell down. She was shocked by this omen, but still she sent them.
The servant, having got a fit opportunity, goes <i>to her brother</i>
and delivers the secret writing. The Mæandrian youth,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag9_55" id = "tag9_55" href = "#note9_55">55</a> seized with
sudden anger, throws away the tablets <i>so</i> received, when he has
read a part; and, with difficulty withholding his hands from the face of
the trembling servant, he says, “Fly hence, O&nbsp;thou accursed pander
to forbidden lust, who shouldst have given me satisfaction by thy death,
if <i>it was</i> not <i>that</i> thy destruction would bring disgrace on
my character.” Frightened, he hastens
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 579-609.</span>
away, and reports to his mistress the threatening expressions of Caunus.
Thou, Byblis, on hearing of his refusal, turnest pale, and thy breast,
beset with an icy chill, is struck with alarm; yet when thy senses
return, so, too, does thy frantic passion return, and thy tongue with
difficulty utters such words as these, the air being struck <i>by thy
accents</i>:</p>

<p>“And deservedly <i>am I thus treated</i>; for why, in my rashness,
did I make the discovery of this wound? why have I so speedily committed
words to a hasty letter, which ought <i>rather</i> to have been
concealed? The feelings of his mind ought first to have been tried
beforehand by me, with ambiguous expressions. Lest he should not follow

to have observed what kind of a breeze it was, and to have scudded over

sails have <i>now</i> no retreat. And besides, was I not forbidden, by
unerring omens, to indulge my passion, at the time when the waxen
<i>tablets</i> fell, as I ordered him to deliver them, and made my hopes
sink to the ground? and ought not either the day to have been changed,

have committed myself to writing, and personally <i>I&nbsp;ought</i> to
have discovered my passion; <i>then</i> he would have seen my tears,
<i>then</i> he would have seen the features of her who loved him;
I&nbsp;might have given utterance to more than what the letter
contained. I&nbsp;might have thrown my arms around his reluctant neck,
and have embraced his feet, and lying <i>on the ground</i>, I&nbsp;might
have begged for life; and if I had been repelled, I&nbsp;might have
seemed on the point of death. All this, <i>I&nbsp;say</i>, I&nbsp;might

have made the attempt; the next best thing is, to urge the
accomplishment of what is begun; for he cannot (suppose I were to
relinquish my design) ever be unmindful of this my attempt; and because
I have desisted, I&nbsp;shall appear to have desired for but an instant,
or even to have been trying him, and to have solicited him with the
intention to betray; or, at least, I&nbsp;shall be thought not to have
been overcome by this God, who with such intensity <i>now</i> burns, and
has burnt my breast, but rather by lust. In fine, I&nbsp;cannot now be
guiltless of a wicked deed; I&nbsp;have both written <i>to him</i>, and
I have solicited <i>him</i>; my inclination has been defiled. Though I
were to add nothing more, I&nbsp;cannot be pronounced innocent: as to
what remains, <i>’twill add</i> much to <i>the gratifying of</i> my

<p><i>Thus</i> she says; and (so great is the unsteadiness of her
wavering mind) though she is loath to try him, she has a wish to try
him, and she exceeds <i>all</i> bounds, and, to her misery, exposes

in her frenzy beat her arms. And now she is openly raving, and she
proclaims the unlawful hopes of <i>unnatural</i> lust. Deprived of these

The woods <i>at length</i> fail thee; when thou, Byblis, wearied with
following him, dost fall down, and laying thy tresses upon the hard
ground, art silent, and dost press the fallen leaves with thy face.
Often, too, do the Lelegeïan Nymphs endeavour to raise her in their
tender arms; often do they advise her to curb her passion, and they
apply consolation to a mind insensible <i>to their advice</i>. Silent
does Byblis lie, and she tears the green herbs with her nails, and
waters the grass with the stream of her tears. They say that the Naiads
placed beneath these <i>tears</i> a channel which could never become
dry; and what greater gift had they to bestow? Immediately, as drops
from the cut bark of the pitch tree, or as the viscid bitumen distils
from the impregnated earth, or as water which has frozen with the cold,
at the approach of Favonius, gently blowing, melts away in the sun, so
is Byblis, the descendant of Phœbus, dissolving in her tears, changed
into a fountain, which even now, in those vallies, bears the name of its
mistress, and flows beneath a gloomy oak.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
This shocking story has been also recounted by Antoninus Liberalis and
both he and Ovid have embellished it with circumstances, which are the
fruit of a lively imagination. They make Byblis travel over several
countries in search of her brother, who flies from her extravagant
passion, and they both agree in tracing her to Caria. There, according
to Antoninus Liberalis, she was transformed into a Hamadryad, just as
she was on
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 665-668.</span>
the point of throwing herself from the summit of a mountain. Ovid, on
the other hand, says that she was changed into a fountain, which
afterwards bore her name.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is, however, most probable, that if the story is founded on truth,
the whole of the circumstances happened in Caria; since we learn, both
from Apollodorus and Pausanias, that Miletus, her father, went from the
island of Crete to lead a colony into Caria, when he conquered a city,
to which he gave his own name. Pausanias says, that all the men of the
city being killed during the siege, the conquerors married their wives
and daughters. Cyanea, the daughter of Mæander, fell to the share of
Miletus, and Caunus and Byblis were the offspring of that marriage.
Byblis, having conceived a criminal passion for her brother, he was
obliged to leave his father’s court, that he might avoid her
importunities; upon which she died of grief. As she often went to weep
by a fountain, which was outside of the town, those who related the
adventure, magnified it, by stating that she was changed into the
fountain, which, after her death, bore her name. We are informed by
Photius, on the authority of the historian Conon, that it was Caunus who
fell in love with Byblis, and that she hanged herself upon a walnut
tree. Ovid also, in his ‘Art of Love,’ follows the tradition that she
hanged herself. ‘Arsit et est laqueo fortiter ulta nefas.’ Miletus lived
in the time of the first Minos, and, according to some writers, married
his daughter Acallis; but, having disagreed with his father-in-law, he
was obliged to leave Crete, and retired to Caria.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Persians had certain state ordinances, by which their monarchs were
enjoined to marry their own sisters; and, as Asia Minor was overrun by
them at the time when Crœsus was conquered by Cyrus, it is possible that
the story of Byblis and Caunus may have originated in the disgust which
the natives felt for their conquerors, and as a covert reproach to them
for sanctioning alliances of so incestuous a nature. While Ovid enters
into details in the story, which trench on the rules of modesty and
decorum, the moral of the tale, aided by some of his precepts, is not
uninstructive as a warning to youth to learn betimes how to regulate the
passions.</p>

<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">Ligdus</span> commands his wife Telethusa, who
is pregnant, to destroy the infant, should it prove to be a girl; on
which, the Goddess Isis appears to her in a dream, and, forbidding her
to obey, promises her her protection. Telethusa is delivered of a
daughter, who is called Iphis, and passes for a son. Iphis is afterwards
married to Ianthe, on which, Isis, to reward her mother’s piety,
transforms her into a man.</p>

<p>The fame of this new prodigy would, perhaps, have filled the hundred
cities of Crete, if Crete had not lately produced a nearer wonder <i>of
her own</i>, in the change of Iphis.</p>

<p>For once on a time the Phæstian land<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_65"
id = "tag9_65" href = "#note9_65">65</a> adjoining to the
<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 668-691.</span>
Gnossian kingdom produced one Ligdus, of obscure name, a&nbsp;man of the
freeborn class of common people. Nor were his means any greater than his
rank, but his life and his honour were untainted. He startled the ears
of his wife in her pregnancy, with these words, when her lying-in was
near at hand: “Two things there are which I wish for; that thou mayst be
delivered with very little pain, and that thou mayst bring forth a male
child. The other alternative is a cause of greater trouble, and
providence has denied us means <i>for bringing up a female</i>. The
thing I abominate; but if a female should, by chance, be brought forth
at thy delivery, (I&nbsp;command it with reluctance, forgive me, natural
affection) let it be put to death.” <i>Thus</i> he said, and they bathed
their faces with tears streaming down; both he who commanded, and she to
whom the commands were given. But yet Telethusa incessantly urged her
husband, with fruitless entreaties, not to confine his hopes within a
compass so limited. <i>But</i> Ligdus’s resolution was fixed.</p>

<p>And now was she hardly <i>able</i> to bear her womb big with the
burden ripe for birth; when in the middle of the night, under the form
of a vision, the daughter of Inachus, attended by a train of her
votaries, either stood, or seemed to stand, before her bed. The horns of
the moon were upon her forehead, with ears of corn with their bright
golden colour, and the royal ornament <i>of the diadem</i>; with her was
the barking Anubis,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_66" id = "tag9_66" href

<span class = "pagenum">336</span>

his finger enjoins silence. There were the sistra too, and Osiris,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag9_70" id = "tag9_70" href = "#note9_70">70</a>
never enough sought for; and the foreign serpent,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9_71" id = "tag9_71" href = "#note9_71">71</a> filled with
soporiferous poison. When thus the Goddess addressed her, as though
roused from her sleep, and seeing <i>all</i> distinctly:
“O&nbsp;Telethusa, one of my votaries, lay aside thy grievous cares, and
evade the commands of thy husband; and do not hesitate, when Lucina
shall have given thee ease by delivery, to bring up <i>the child</i>,
whatever it shall be. I&nbsp;am a befriending Goddess,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag9_72" id = "tag9_72" href = "#note9_72">72</a> and, when
invoked, I&nbsp;give assistance; and thou shalt not complain that thou
hast worshipped an ungrateful Divinity.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> she advises her, and <i>then</i> retires from her
chamber. The Cretan matron arises joyful from her bed; and suppliantly
raising her pure hands towards the stars <i>of heaven</i>, prays that
her vision may be fulfilled. When her pains increased, and her burden
forced itself into the light, and a girl was born to the father unaware
of it, the mother ordered it to be brought up, pretending it was a boy;
and the thing gained belief, nor was any one but the nurse acquainted
with the fact. The father performed his vows, and gave <i>the child</i>
the name of its grandfather. The grandfather had been called Iphis. The
mother rejoiced in that name because it was common <i>to both sexes</i>,
nor would she be deceiving<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_73" id =
"tag9_73" href = "#note9_73">73</a> any one by it. Her deception lay
unperceived under this fraud, the result of natural affection. The
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 711-743.</span>
<i>child’s</i> dress was that of a boy; the face such, that, whether you
gave it to a girl or to a boy, either would be beautiful. In the
meantime the third year had <i>now</i> succeeded the tenth, when her
father, O&nbsp;Iphis, promised to thee, in marriage, the yellow-haired
Iänthe, who was a virgin the most commended among all the women of
Phæstus, for the endowments of her beauty; the daughter of the Dictæan
Telestes. Equal was their age, their beauty equal; and they received
their first instruction, the elements <i>suited</i> to their age, from
the same preceptor.</p>

<p>Love, in consequence, touches the inexperienced breasts of them both,
and inflicts on each an equal wound; but <i>how</i> different are their
hopes! Iänthe awaits the time of their union, and of the ceremonial
agreed upon, and believes that she, whom she thinks to be a man, will be
<i>her husband</i>. Iphis is in love with her whom she despairs to be
able to enjoy, and this very thing increases her flame; and,
<i>herself</i> a maid, she burns with passion for a maid. And, with
difficulty, suppressing her tears, she says, “What issue <i>of my
love</i> awaits me, whom the anxieties unknown to any <i>before</i>, and
<i>so</i> unnatural, of an unheard-of passion, have seized upon? if the
Gods would spare me, (they ought to have destroyed me, and if they would
not have destroyed me), at least they should have inflicted some natural
evil, and <i>one</i> common <i>to the human race</i>. Passion for a cow
does not inflame a cow, nor does that for mares <i>inflame</i> the
mares. The ram inflames the ewes; its own female follows the buck. And
so do birds couple; and among all animals, no female is seized with
passion for a female. Would that I did not exist.</p>

<p>“Yet, lest Crete might not be the producer of <i>all kinds of</i>
prodigies, the daughter of the Sun loved a bull; that is to say,
a&nbsp;female <i>loved</i> a male. My passion, if I confess the truth,
is more extravagant than that. Still she pursued the hopes of enjoyment;
still, by a subtle contrivance, and under the form of a cow, did she
couple with the bull, and her paramour was one that might be deceived.
But though the ingenuity of the whole world were to centre here, though
Dædalus himself were to fly back again with his waxen wings, what could
he do? Could he, by his skilful arts, make me from a maiden into a
youth? or could he transform
<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<span class = "linenum">ix. 743-772.</span>
thee, Iänthe? But why dost thou not fortify thy mind, and recover
thyself, Iphis? And why not shake off this passion, void of <i>all</i>
reason, and senseless <i>as it is</i>? Consider what it was thou wast
born (unless thou art deceiving thyself as well), and pursue that which
is allowable, and love that which, as a woman, thou oughtst <i>to
love</i>. Hope it is that produces, Hope it is that nourishes love.
This, the <i>very</i> case <i>itself</i> deprives thee of. No guard is
keeping thee away from her dear embrace; no care of a watchful husband,
no father’s severity; does not she herself deny thy solicitations. And
yet she cannot be enjoyed by thee; nor, were everything possible done,
couldst thou be blessed; <i>not</i>, though Gods and men were to do
their utmost. And now, too, no portion of my desires is baffled, and the
compliant Deities have granted me whatever they were able, and what I
<i>desire</i>, my father wishes, she herself wishes, and <i>so does</i>
my destined father-in-law; but nature, more powerful than all these,
wills it not; she alone is an obstacle to me. Lo, the longed-for time
approaches, and the wedding-day is at hand, when Iänthe should be mine;
and <i>yet</i> she will not fall to my lot. In the midst of water,
I&nbsp;shall be athirst. Why, Juno, guardian of the marriage rites, and
why, Hymenæus, do you come to this ceremonial, where there is not the
person who should marry <i>the wife</i>, <i>and</i> where both <i>of us
females</i>, we are coupled in wedlock?”</p>

<p>After <i>saying</i> these words, she closes her lips. And no less
does the other maid burn, and she prays thee, Hymenæus, to come quickly.
Telethusa, dreading the same thing that she desires, at one time puts
off the time <i>of the wedding</i>, and then raises delays, by feigning
illness. Often, by way of excuse, she pretends omens and visions. But
now she has exhausted all the resources of fiction; and the time for the
marriage <i>so long</i> delayed is <i>now</i> at hand, and <i>only</i>
one day remains; whereon she takes off the fillets for the hair from her
own head and from that of her daughter,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_74"
id = "tag9_74" href = "#note9_74">74</a> and embracing the altar with
dishevelled locks, she says, “O&nbsp;Isis, thou who dost inhabit

ease me of my fears. Thee, Goddess, thee, I&nbsp;once beheld, and these
thy symbols; and all <i>of them</i> I recognized; both thy attendants,
and thy torches, and the sound of the sistra, and I noted thy commands
with mindful care. That this <i>girl</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag9_78" id = "tag9_78" href = "#note9_78">78</a> <i>now</i> sees the
light, that I, myself, am not punished, is <i>the result of</i> thy
counsel, and thy admonition; pity us both, and aid us with thy
assistance.”</p>

<p>Tears followed her words. The Goddess seemed to move, (and she
<i>really</i> did move) her altars; and the doors of her temple shook.
Her horns, too,<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_79" id = "tag9_79" href =
"#note9_79">79</a> shone, resembling <i>those of</i> the moon, and the
tinkling sistrum sounded. The mother departs from the temple, not free
from concern indeed, still pleased with this auspicious omen. Iphis
follows her, her companion as she goes, with longer strides than she had
been wont; her fairness does not continue on her face; both her strength
is increased, and her features are more stern; and shorter is the length
of her scattered locks. There is more vigour, also, than she had
<i>as</i> a female. <i>And</i> now thou art a male, who so lately wast a
female. Bring offerings to the temple, and rejoice with no hesitating
confidence. They do bring their offerings to the temple. They add, too,

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Iphis being changed from a young woman into a man, of which
Ovid lays the scene in the isle of Crete, is one of those facts upon
which ancient history is entirely silent. Perhaps, the origin of the
story was a disguise of a damsel in male dress, carried on, for family
reasons, even to the very point of marriage; or it may have been based
upon an account of some remarkable instance of androgynous
formation.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_14" id = "note9_14" href = "#tag9_14">14.</a>
<i>Wheel of thy father.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 124. He alludes to the
punishment of Ixion, the father of Nessus, who was fastened to a
revolving wheel in the Infernal Regions, as a punishment for his attempt
on the chastity of Juno.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_15" id = "note9_15" href = "#tag9_15">15.</a>

horse part.’</p>

<p><a name = "note9_16" id = "note9_16" href = "#tag9_16">16.</a>
<i>Cenæan Jupiter.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 136. Jupiter was called Cenæan, from
Cenæum, a&nbsp;promontory of Eubœa, where Hercules, after having taken
the town of Œchalia, built an altar in honour of Jupiter. Hercules slew
Eurytus, the king of Œchalia, and carried away his daughter Iole.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_17" id = "note9_17" href = "#tag9_17">17.</a>
<i>Lichas.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 155. This was the attendant of Hercules, whom

earth.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_19" id = "note9_19" href = "#tag9_19">19.</a>
<i>Iberian shepherd.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 184. Allusion is here made to
Geryon, who had three bodies, and whom Hercules slew, and then carried
away his herds. It has been suggested that the story of his triple form
originated in the fact that he and his two brothers reigned amicably in
conjunction over some portion of Spain, or the islands adjoining to
it.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_20" id = "note9_20" href = "#tag9_20">20.</a>
<i>Parthenian.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 188. A&nbsp;part of Arcadia was so called
from Parthenium, a&nbsp;mountain which divided it from Argolis; there

<i>Gold of Thermodon.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 189. The Thermodon was a river of
Scythia, near which the Amazons were said to dwell. Eurystheus ordered

Amazons.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_22" id = "note9_22" href = "#tag9_22">22.</a>
<i>Support the heavens.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 198. Atlas, king of Mauritania,
was said to support the heavens on his shoulders, of which burden
Hercules relieved him for a time, when he partook of his hospitality. It
has been suggested that the meaning of this story is, that Hercules
learned the study of astronomy from Atlas.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_23" id = "note9_23" href = "#tag9_23">23.</a>
<i>Wife of Jupiter.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 199. Juno gave her commands to
Hercules through Eurystheus, the son of Sthenelus, king of Mycenæ, who
imposed upon him his various labours.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_24" id = "note9_24" href = "#tag9_24">24.</a>
<i>Many a hailstone.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 222. Ovid here seems to think that
snow is an intermediate state between rain and hail, and that hail is
formed by the rapid motion of the snow as it falls.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_25" id = "note9_25" href = "#tag9_25">25.</a>

Pœas.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_26" id = "note9_26" href = "#tag9_26">26.</a>
<i>Again to visit.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 232. It was decreed by the destinies
that Troy should not be taken, unless the bow and arrows of Hercules
were present; for which reason it was necessary to send for Philoctetes,
who was the possessor of them. Troy had already seen them, when Hercules
punished Laomedon, its king, for his perfidious conduct.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_27" id = "note9_27" href = "#tag9_27">27.</a>

<i>Protector of the earth.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 241. Hercules merited this

to have been the same either with Diana, or Juno Lucina.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_31" id = "note9_31" href = "#tag9_31">31.</a>
<i>The two Nixi.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 294. Festus says, ‘the three statues in
the Capitol, before the shrine of Minerva, were called the Gods Nixii.’
Nothing whatever is known of these Gods, who appear to have been
obstetrical Divinities. It has been suggested, as there were three of
them, that the reading should be, not ‘Nixosque pares,’ but ‘Nixosque
Lares,’ ‘and the Lares the Nixi.’</p>

<p><a name = "note9_32" id = "note9_32" href = "#tag9_32">32.</a>
<i>Form of a comb.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 299. This charm probably was
suggestive of difficult or impeded parturition, the bones of the pelvis
being firmly knit together in manner somewhat resembling the fingers
when inserted one between the other, instead of yielding for the passage
of the infant. Pliny the Elder informs us how parturition may be impeded
by the use of charms.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_33" id = "note9_33" href = "#tag9_33">33.</a>
<i>Something unusual.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 309. ‘Nescio quid.’ This very
indefinite phrase is repeatedly used by Ovid; and in such cases, it
expresses either actual doubt or uncertainty, as in the present
instance; or it is used to denote something remarkable or indescribable,
or to show that a thing is insignificant, mean, and contemptible.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_34" id = "note9_34" href = "#tag9_34">34.</a>
<i>Goddess who presides.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 315. This was Ilithyïa, or
Lucina, who was acting as the emissary of Juno.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_35" id = "note9_35" href = "#tag9_35">35.</a>
<i>From the mouth.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 323. This notion is supposed to have
been grounded on the fact of the weasel (like many other animals)
carrying her young in her mouth from place to place.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_36" id = "note9_36" href = "#tag9_36">36.</a>

Dryope.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_39" id = "note9_39" href = "#tag9_39">39.</a>
<i>From my eyes.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 390. This alludes to the custom among
the ancients of closing the eyes of the dying, which duty was performed
by the nearest relations, who, closing the eyes and mouth, called upon
the dying person by name, and exclaimed ‘Vale,’ ‘farewell.’</p>

<i>Civil warfare.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 404. This alludes to the Theban war,
carried on between Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of Œdipus and
Jocasta. Agreeing to reign in alternate years, Eteocles refused to give
place to his brother when his year had terminated, on which Polynices
fled to the court of Adrastus, king of Argos, and raised troops against
his brother.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_42" id = "note9_42" href = "#tag9_42">42.</a>
<i>While he still lives.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 407. This was Amphiaraüs, the
son of Œcleus, and Hypermnestra, who was betrayed by his wife
Eriphyle.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_43" id = "note9_43" href = "#tag9_43">43.</a>
<i>Daughter-in-law.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 415. Hebe, the Goddess of Youth, was
the daughter of Juno alone, without the participation of Jupiter; and
from this circumstance she is styled the step-daughter of Jupiter. She
was also his daughter-in-law on becoming the wife of Hercules.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_44" id = "note9_44" href = "#tag9_44">44.</a>
<i>The complaint was.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 420. ‘Murmur erat,’ is rendered by
Clarke, ‘The grumbling was, why, &amp;c.’</p>

<i>Iäsion.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 422. Iäsius, or Iäsion, was the son of
Jupiter and Electra, and was the father of Plutus, the God of Riches, by
the Goddess Cybele.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_46" id = "note9_46" href = "#tag9_46">46.</a>
<i>Every God has.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 425-6. ‘Cui studeat, Deus omnis habet
crescitque favore Turbida seditio.’ Clarke thus renders these words,
‘Every God has somebody to stickle for, and a turbulent sedition arises
by their favours for their darlings.’</p>

<p><a name = "note9_47" id = "note9_47" href = "#tag9_47">47.</a>
<i>Son of Deione.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 442. According to some writers,
Miletus was the son of Apollo and Deione, though others say that Thia
was the name of his mother. He was the founder of the celebrated city of
Miletus, in Caria, a&nbsp;country of Asia Minor.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_48" id = "note9_48" href = "#tag9_48">48.</a>
<i>Does not think.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 457. Clarke translates this line,
‘Nor does she think she does amiss that she so often tips him a kiss.’
Antoninus Liberalis says, that Eidothea, the daughter of the king of
Paria, and not Cyane, was the mother of Byblis and Caunus.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_49" id = "note9_49" href = "#tag9_49">49.</a>
<i>Sweetheart.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 465. The word ‘dominus’ was often used as
a term of endearment between lovers.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_50" id = "note9_50" href = "#tag9_50">50.</a>
<i>Married Ops.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 497. Ops, the daughter of Cœlus or
Uranus, who was also called Cybele, Rhea, and ‘the great Mother,’ was
fabled to have been the wife of her brother Saturn; while Oceanus, the
son of Cœlus and Vesta, married his sister Tethys.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_51" id = "note9_51" href = "#tag9_51">51.</a>
<i>Sons of Æolus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 506. Æolus had six sons, to whom he
was said to have given their sisters for wives. In the case, however, of
his daughter Canace, who was pregnant by her brother Macareus, Æolus was
more severe, as he sent her a sword, with which to put herself to
death.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_52" id = "note9_52" href = "#tag9_52">52.</a>
<i>Clean wax tablets.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 521. Before the tablet was written
upon, the wax was ‘vacua,’ empty; or, as we say of writing-paper,
‘clean.’ There was a blunt end to the upper part of the ‘stylus,’ or
iron pen, with which the wax was smoothed down when any writing was
erased.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_53" id = "note9_53" href = "#tag9_53">53.</a>

<p><a name = "note9_56" id = "note9_56" href = "#tag9_56">56.</a>
<i>Part of my sail.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 589. She borrows this metaphor from
sailors, who, before setting out, sometimes unfurl a little portion of
the sail, to see how the wind blows.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_57" id = "note9_57" href = "#tag9_57">57.</a>

Bacchus.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_61" id = "note9_61" href = "#tag9_61">61.</a>
<i>Bubasian matrons.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 643. We learn from Pliny the Elder
that Bubasus was a region of Caria.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_62" id = "note9_62" href = "#tag9_62">62.</a>
<i>Leleges.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 644. The Leleges were a warlike people of
Caria, in Asia Minor, who were supposed to have sprung from Grecian
emigrants, who first inhabited the adjacent island, and afterwards the
continent. They were said to have their name from the Greek word <span

because they were collected from various places.</p>

built by Minos.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_66" id = "note9_66" href = "#tag9_66">66.</a>
<i>Anubis.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 689. This was an Egyptian Deity, which had
the body of a man, and the head of a dog. Some writers say that it was
Mercury who was so represented, and that this form was given him in
remembrance of the fact of Isis having used dogs in her search for
Osiris, when he was slain by his brother Typhon. Other authors say, that
Anubis was the son of Osiris, and that he distinguished himself with an
helmet, bearing the figure of a dog, when he followed his father to
battle.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_67" id = "note9_67" href = "#tag9_67">67.</a>
<i>Bubastis.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 690. Though she is here an attendant of
Isis, Diodorus Siculus represents her to have been the same divinity as
Isis. Herodotus, however, says that Diana was worshipped by the
Egyptians under that name. There was a city of Lower Egypt, called
Bubastis, in which Isis was greatly venerated.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_68" id = "note9_68" href = "#tag9_68">68.</a>
<i>Apis.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 690. This is supposed to have been another name
for Osiris, whose body, having been burned on the funeral pile, the
Egyptians believed that he re-appeared under the form of a bull; the
name for which animal was ‘apis.’</p>

<i>Who suppresses.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 691. This was the Egyptian divinity

his finger laid on his lips.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_70" id = "note9_70" href = "#tag9_70">70.</a>
<i>Osiris.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 692. When slain by his brother Typhon, Isis
long sought him in vain, till, finding his scattered limbs by the aid of
dogs, she entombed them. As the Egyptians had a yearly festival, at
which they bewailed the loss of Osiris, and feigned that they were
seeking him, Ovid calls that God, ‘Nunquam satis quæsitus,’ ‘Never
enough sought for.’</p>

<p><a name = "note9_71" id = "note9_71" href = "#tag9_71">71.</a>
<i>Foreign serpent.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 693. This is, most probably, the
asp, a&nbsp;small serpent of Egypt, which is frequently found
represented on the statues of Isis. Its bite was said to produce a
lethargic sleep, ending in death. Cleopatra ended her life by the bite
of one, which she ordered to be conveyed to her in a basket of fruit.
Some commentators have supposed that the crocodile is here alluded to;
but, as others have justly observed, the crocodile has no poisonous
sting, but rather a capacity for devouring.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_72" id = "note9_72" href = "#tag9_72">72.</a>
<i>A befriending Goddess.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 698. Diodorus Siculus says,
that Isis was the discoverer of numerous remedies for disease, and that
she greatly improved the healing art.</p>

<i>Be deceiving.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 709. The name ‘Iphis’ being equally
well for a male or a female.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_74" id = "note9_74" href = "#tag9_74">74.</a>
<i>Of her daughter.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 770. We must suppose that Iphis wore
the ‘vitta,’ which was an article of female dress, in private only, and
in presence of her mother. Of course, in public, such an ornament would
not have suited her, when appearing in the character of a man.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_75" id = "note9_75" href = "#tag9_75">75.</a>
<i>Parætonium.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 772. Strabo says, that Parætonium was a

<i>This girl.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 778. Pointing at Iphis, who had attended
her, Antoninus Liberalis says, that Telethusa prayed that Iphis might be
transformed into a man, and cited a number of precedents for such a
change.</p>

<p><a name = "note9_79" id = "note9_79" href = "#tag9_79">79.</a>
<i>Her horns too.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 783. Isis was sometimes worshipped
under the form of a cow, to the horns of which reference is here
made.</p>

were the guardians of conjugal rites.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Eurydice</span>, the wife of Orpheus, while
sporting in the fields, with other Nymphs, is bitten by a serpent, which
causes her death. After having mourned for her, Orpheus resolves to go
down to the Infernal Regions in quest of her. Pluto and the Fates
consent to her return, on condition that Orpheus shall not look on her
till he is out of their dominions. His curiosity prevailing, he neglects
this injunction, on which she is immediately snatched away from him,
beyond the possibility of recovery. Upon this occasion, the Poet relates
the story of a shepherd, who was turned into a rock by a look of
Cerberus; and that of Olenus and Lethæa, who were transformed into
stones.</p>

<p>Thence Hymenæus, clad in a saffron-coloured<a class = "tag" name =

presented himself indeed, but he brought with him neither auspicious
words, nor joyful looks, nor <i>yet</i> a happy omen. The torch, too,
which he held, was hissing with a smoke that brought tears to the eyes,
and as it was, it found no flames amid its waving. The issue was more
disastrous than the omens; for the <ins class = "correction" title =

into whom a serpent, trodden upon <i>by her</i>, diffused its poison,
and cut short her growing years. I&nbsp;was wishful to be able to endure
<i>this</i>, and I will not deny that I have endeavoured <i>to do
so</i>. Love has proved the stronger. That God is well known in the
regions above. Whether he be so here, too, I&nbsp;am uncertain; but yet
I imagine that even here he is; and if the story of the rape of former
days is not untrue, ’twas love that united you <i>two</i> together. By

lasting dominion over the human race. She, too, when, in due season she

your sway. The enjoyment <i>of her</i> I beg as a favour. But if the

determined that I will not return. Triumph in the death of us both.”</p>

<p>As he said such things, and touched the strings to his words, the
bloodless spirits wept. Tantalus did not catch at the retreating water,
and the wheel of Ixion stood still, <i>as though</i> in amazement; the
birds did not tear the liver <i>of Tityus</i>; and the granddaughters of
Belus paused at their urns; thou, too, Sisyphus, didst seat thyself on
thy stone. The story is, that then, for the first time, the cheeks of
the Eumenides, overcome by his music, were wet with tears; nor could the
royal consort, nor he who rules the infernal regions, endure
<span class = "pagenum">343</span>

to deny him his request; and they called for Eurydice. She was among the
shades newly arrived, and she advanced with a slow pace, by reason of
her wound.</p>

<p>The Rhodopeïan hero receives her, and, at the same time, <i>this</i>
condition, that he turn not back his eyes until he has passed the
Avernian vallies, or else that the grant will be revoked. The ascending
path is mounted in deep silence, steep, dark, and enveloped in deepening
gloom. And <i>now</i> they were not far from the verge of the upper
earth. He, enamoured, fearing lest she should flag, and impatient to
behold her, turned his eyes; and immediately she sank back again. She,
hapless one! both stretching out her arms, and struggling to be grasped,
and to grasp him, caught nothing but the fleeting air. And now, dying a
second time, she did not at all complain of her husband; for why should
she complain of being beloved? And now she pronounced the last farewell,
which scarcely did he catch with his ears; and again was she hurried
back to the same place.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Though Ovid has separated the adventures of Orpheus, whose death he does
not relate till the beginning of the eleventh Book, we will here shortly
enter upon an examination of some of the more important points of his
history.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
As, in his time, Poetry and Music were in a very low state of
perfection, and as he excelled in both of those arts, it was said that
he was the son of Apollo and the Muse Calliope; and it was added, that
he charmed lions and tigers, and made even the trees sensible of the
melodious tones of his lyre. These were mere hyperbolical expressions,
which signified the wondrous charms of his eloquence and of his music
combined, which he employed in cultivating the genius of a savage and
uncouth people. Some conjecture that this personage originally came from
Asia into Thrace, and suppose that he, together with Linus and Eumolpus,
brought poetry and music into Greece, the use of which, till then, was
unknown in that country; and that they introduced, at the same time, the
worship of Ceres, Mars, and the orgies of Bacchus, which, from him who
instituted them, received their name of ‘Orphica.’ Orpheus, <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘to’">too</ins>, is supposed to have
united the office of high priest with that of king. Horace styles him
the interpreter of the Gods; and he was said to have interposed with the
Deities for the deliverance of the Argonauts from a dangerous tempest.
It is thought that he passed some part of his life in Egypt, and became
acquainted with many particulars of the ancient religion of the
Egyptians, which he introduced into the theology of Greece. Some modern
writers even go so far as to suggest that he learned from the
<span class = "pagenum">345</span>
Hebrews, who were then sojourning in Egypt, the knowledge of the true
God.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
His wife, Eurydice, dying very young, he was inconsolable for her loss.
To alleviate his grief, he went to Thesprotia, in Epirus, the natives of
which region were said to possess incantations, for the purpose of
raising the ghosts of the departed. Here, according to some accounts,
being deceived by a phantom, which was made to appear before him, he
died of sorrow; but, according to other writers, he renounced the
society of mankind for ever and retired to the mountains of Thrace. His
journey to that distant country gave occasion to say, that he descended
to the Infernal Regions. This is the more likely, as he is supposed to
have there promulgated his notions of the infernal world, which,
according to Diodorus Siculus, he had learned among the Egyptians.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Tzetzes, however, assures us that this part of his history is founded on
the circumstance, that Orpheus cured his wife of the bite of a serpent,
which had till then been considered to be mortal; and that the poets
gave an hyperbolical version of the story, in saying that he had rescued
her from Hell. He says, too, that he had learned in Egypt the art of
magic, which was much cultivated there, and especially the method of
charming serpents.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
After the loss of his wife, he retired to mount Rhodope, to assuage the
violence of his grief. There, according to Ovid and other poets, the
Mænades, or Bacchanals, to be revenged for his contempt of them and
their rites, tore him in pieces; which story is somewhat diversified by
the writers who relate that Venus, exasperated against Calliope, the
mother of Orpheus, for having adjudged to Proserpine the possession of
Adonis, caused the women of Thrace to become enamoured of her son, and
to tear him in pieces while disputing the possession of him. An ancient
author, quoted by Hyginus, says that Orpheus was killed by the stroke of
a thunderbolt, while he was accompanying the Argonauts; and Apollodorus
says the same. Diodorus Siculus calls him one of the kings of Thrace;
while other writers, among whom are Cicero and Aristotle, assert that
there never was such a person as Orpheus. The learned Vossius says, that
the Phœnician word ‘ariph,’ which signifies ‘learned,’ gave rise to the
story of Orpheus. Le Clerc thinks that in consequence of the same Greek
word signifying ‘an enchanter,’ and also meaning ‘a singer,’ he acquired
the reputation of having been a most skilful magician.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
We may, perhaps, safely conclude, that Orpheus really did introduce the
worship of many Gods into Greece; and that, possibly, while he
promulgated the necessity of expiating crimes, he introduced exorcism,
and brought magic into fashion in Greece. Lucian affirms that he was
also the first to teach the elements of astronomy. Several works were
attributed to him, which are now no longer in existence; among which
were a Poem on the Expedition of the Argonauts, one on the War of the
Giants, another on the Rape of Proserpine, and a fourth upon the Labours
of Hercules. The Poem on the Argonautic Expedition, which now exists,
and is attributed to him, is supposed to have been really written by a
poet named Onomacritus, who lived in the sixth century <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>, in the time of Pisistratus.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">346</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 86-99.</span>
<p class = "explanation">
After his death, Orpheus was reckoned in the number of Heroes or
Demigods; and we are informed by Philostratus that his head was
preserved at Lesbos, where it gave oracular responses. Orpheus is not
mentioned by Homer or Hesiod. The learned scholar Lobeck, in his
Aglaophamus, has entered very deeply into an investigation of the real
nature of the discoveries and institutions ascribed to him.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Attis, or Athis, here briefly referred to, is related by
the ancient writers in many different ways; so much so, that it is not
possible to reconcile the discrepancy that exists between them. From
Diodorus Siculus we learn that Cybele, the daughter of Mæon, King of
Phrygia, falling in love with a young shepherd named Attis, her father
ordered him to be put to death. In despair, at the loss of her lover,
Cybele left her father’s abode, and, accompanied by Marsyas, crossed the
mountains of Phrygia. Apollo, (or, as Vossius supposes, some priest of
that God,) touched with the misfortunes of the damsel, took her to the
country of the Hyperboreans in Scythia, where she died. Some time after,
the plague ravaging Phrygia, and the oracle being consulted, an answer
was returned, that, to ensure the ceasing of the contagion, they must
look for the body of Attis, and give it funeral rites, and render to
Cybele the same honour which they were wont to pay to the Gods: all
which was done with such scrupulous care, that in time she became one of
the most esteemed Divinities.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Arnobius, says that Attis was a shepherd, with whom Cybele fell in love
in her old age. Unmoved by her rank, and repelled by her faded charms,
he despised her advances. Midas, King of Pessinus, on seeing this,
destined his own daughter, Agdistis, for the young Attis. Fearing the
resentment of Cybele, he caused the gates of the city to be shut on the
day on which the marriage was to be solemnized. Cybele being informed of
this, hastened to Pessinus, and, destroying the gates, met with Attis,
who had concealed himself behind a pine tree, and caused him to be
emasculated; on which Agdistis committed self-destruction in a fit of
sorrow.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Servius, Lactantius, and St. Augustine, give another version of the
story, which it is not necessary here to enlarge upon, any farther than
to say, that it depicts the love of a powerful queen for a young man who
repulsed her advances. Ovid, also, gives a similar account in the fourth
Book of the Fasti, line 220. Other authors, quoted by Arnobius, have
given some additional circumstances, the origin of which it is
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 106-114.</span>
almost impossible to guess at. They say that a female called Nana, by
touching a pomegranate or an almond tree, which grew from the blood of
Agdistis whom Bacchus had slain, conceived Attis, who afterwards became
very dear to Cybele.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
All that we can conclude from these accounts, and more especially from
that given by Ovid in the Fasti, is, that the worship of Cybele being
established in Phrygia, Attis was one of her priests; and that, as he
led the example of mutilating himself, all her other priests, who were
called Galli, submitted to a similar operation, to the great surprise of
the uninitiated, who were not slow in inventing some wonderful story to
account for an act so extraordinary.</p>

hollow temples. He, too, void of fear, and laying aside his natural
timorousness, used to frequent the houses, and to offer his neck to be
patted by any hands, even though unknown <i>to him</i>.</p>

<p>But yet, above all others, he was pleasing to thee, Cyparissus, most
beauteous of the nation of Cea.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_22" id =

the purple bridle. ’Twas summer and the middle of the day, and the
bending arms of the Crab, that loves the sea-shore, were glowing with
the heat of the sun; the stag, fatigued, was reclining his body on the
grassy earth, and was enjoying the coolness from the shade of a tree. By
inadvertence the boy Cyparissus pierced him with a sharp javelin; and,
when he saw him dying from the cruel wound, he resolved to attempt to
die <i>as well</i>. What consolations did not Phœbus apply? and he
advised him to grieve with moderation, and

requested this of the Gods above, that he might mourn for ever. And now,
his blood quite exhausted by incessant weeping, his limbs began to be
changed into a green colour, and the hair, which but lately hung from
his snow-white forehead, to become a rough bush, and, a&nbsp;stiffness
being assumed, to point to the starry heavens with a tapering top. The
God <i>Phœbus</i> lamented deeply, and in his sorrow he said, “Thou
shalt be mourned by me, and shalt mourn for others, and shalt
<i>ever</i> attend upon those who are sorrowing<a class = "tag" name =

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Cyparissus, who, according to Ovid was born at Carthæa, a&nbsp;town in
the isle of Cea, was probably a youth of considerable poetical talent
and proficiency in the polite arts, which caused him to be deemed the
favourite of Apollo. His transformation into a Cypress is founded on the
resemblance between their names, that tree being called by the Greeks
<span class = "greek" title = "kuparissos">κυπάρισσος</span>. The
conclusion of the story is that Apollo, to console himself, enjoined
that the Cypress tree should be the symbol of sorrow, or in other words
that it should be used at funerals and be planted near graves and
sepulchres; which fiction was most likely founded on the fact, that the
tree was employed for those purposes; perhaps because its branches,
almost destitute of leaves, have a somewhat melancholy aspect.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Some ancient writers also tell us that Cyparissus was a youth beloved by
the God Sylvanus, for which reason that God is often represented with
branches of Cypress in his hand.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The rape of Ganymede is probably based upon an actual occurrence, which
may be thus explained. Tros, the king of Troy, having conquered several
of his neighbours, as Eusebius, Cedrenus, and Suidas relate, sent his
son Ganymede into Lydia, accompanied by several of the nobles of his
court, to offer sacrifice in the temple dedicated to Jupiter; Tantalus,
the king of that country, who was ignorant of the designs of the Trojan
king, took his people for spies, and put Ganymede in prison. He having
been arrested in a temple of Jupiter, by order of a prince, whose ensign
was an eagle, it gave occasion for the report that he had been carried
off by Jupiter in the shape of an eagle.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The reason why Jupiter is said to have made Ganymede his cup-bearer
<span class = "pagenum">352</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 162-168.</span>
is difficult to conjecture, unless we suppose that he had served his
father, in that employment at the Trojan court. The poets say that he
was placed by the Gods among the Constellations, where he shines as
Aquarius, or the Water-bearer.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The capture of Ganymede occasioned a protracted and bloody war between
Tros and Tantalus; and after their death, Ilus, the son of Tros,
continued it against Pelops, the son of Tantalus, and obliged him to
quit his kingdom and retire to the court of Œnomaüs, king of Pisa, whose
daughter he married, and by her had a son named Atreus, who was the
father of Agamemnon and Menelaüs. Thus we see that probably Paris, the
great grandson of Tros, carried off Helen, as a reprisal on Menelaüs,
the great grandson of Tantalus, the persecutor of Ganymede. Agamemnon
did not fail to turn this fact to his own advantage, by putting the
Greeks in mind of the evils which his family had suffered from the kings
of Troy.</p>

First, Phœbus tossed it, well poised, into the airy breeze, and clove
the opposite clouds with its weight. After a long pause, the heavy mass
fell on the hard ground, and showed skill united with strength.
Immediately the Tænarian youth,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_30" id =

on by eagerness for the sport, hastened to take up the circlet; but the

bears up thy sinking limbs; and at one moment he cherishes thee, at
another, he stanches thy sad wound; <i>and</i> now he stops the fleeting

incurable. As if, in a well-watered garden, any one should break down
violets, or poppies, and lilies, as they adhere to their yellow stalks;
drooping, they

would suddenly hang down their languid heads, and could not support
themselves; and would look towards the ground with their tops. So sink
his dying features; and, forsaken by its vigour, the neck is a burden to
itself, and reclines upon the shoulder. ‘Son of Œbalus,’ says Phœbus,
‘thou fallest, deprived of thy early youth; and I look on thy wound as
my own condemnation. Thou art <i>the object of</i> my grief, and <i>the
cause of</i> my crime. With thy death is my right hand to be charged;
I&nbsp;am the author of thy destruction. Yet what is my fault? unless to
engage in sport can be termed a fault; unless it can be called a fault,
too, to have loved thee. And oh! that I could give my life for thee, or
together with thee; but since I am restrained by the decrees of destiny,
thou shalt ever be with me, and shalt dwell on my mindful lips. The lyre
struck with my hand, my songs, too, shall celebrate thee; and,

purple, and it assumes the appearance which lilies <i>have</i>, were

Hyacinthus, as Pausanias relates, was a youth of Laconia. His father
educated him with so much care, that he was looked upon as the favourite
of Apollo, and of the Muses. As he was one day playing with his
companions, he unfortunately received a blow on the head from a quoit,
from the effects of which he died soon after. Some funeral verses were
probably composed on the occasion; in which it was said, with the view
of comforting his relations, that Boreas, jealous of the affection which
Apollo had evinced for the youth, had turned aside the quoit with which
they played; and thus, by degrees, in length of time the name of Apollo
became inseparably connected with the story.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Lacedæmonians each year celebrated a solemn festival near his tomb,
where they offered sacrifices to him; and we are told by Athenæus, that
they instituted games in his honour, which were called after his name.
Pausanias makes mention of his tomb, upon which he says was engraved the
figure of Apollo. His alleged change into the flower of the same name is
probably solely owing to the similarity of their names. It is not very
clear what flower it is that was known to the ancients under the name of
Hyacinthus. Dioscorides believes it to be that called ‘vaccinium’ by the
Romans, which is
<span class = "pagenum">356</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 220-240.</span>
of a purple colour, and on which can be traced, though imperfectly, the
letters <span class = "greek" title = "ai">αἰ</span> (alas!) mentioned
by Ovid. The lamentations of Apollo, on the death of Hyacinthus, formed
the subject of bitter, and, indeed, deserved raillery, for several of
the satirical writers among the ancients.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The Cerastæ, a&nbsp;people of the island of Cyprus, were, perhaps, said
to have been changed into bulls, to show the barbarous nature and rustic
manners of those islanders, who stained their altars with the blood of
strangers, in sacrifice to the Gods.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
An equivocation of names also, probably, aided in originating the story.
The island of Cyprus is surrounded with promontories which rise out of
the sea, and whose pointed rocks appear at a distance like horns, from
which it had the name of Cerastis, the Greek word <span class = "greek"
title = "keras">κέρας</span>, signifying a ‘horn.’ Thus, the inhabitants
having the name of Cerastæ, it was most easy to invent a fiction of
their having been once turned into oxen, to account the more readily for
their bearing that name.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Propœtides, who inhabited the same island, were females of very
dissolute character. Justin, and other writers, mention a singular and
horrible custom in that island, of prostituting young girls in the very
temple of Venus. It was most probably the utter disregard of these women
for common decency, that occasioned the poets to say that they were
transformed into rocks.</p>

resolves on leading a life of perpetual celibacy. Falling in love with a
statue which he has made, Venus animates it; on which he marries this
new object of his affections, and has a son by her, who gives his name
to the island.</p>

<p>“When Pygmalion saw these women spending their lives in criminal
pursuits, shocked at the vices which Nature had <i>so</i> plentifully
imparted to the female disposition, he lived a single life without a
wife, and for a long time was without a partner of his bed. In the
meantime, he ingeniously carved <i>a&nbsp;statue of</i> snow-white ivory
with wondrous skill; and gave it a beauty with which no woman can be
born; and <i>then</i> conceived a passion for his own workmanship. The
appearance was that of a real virgin, whom you might suppose to be
alive, and if
<span class = "pagenum">358</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 251-282.</span>
modesty did not hinder her, to be desirous to move; so much did art lie
concealed under his skill. Pygmalion admires it; and entertains, within
his breast, a&nbsp;flame for this fictitious body.</p>

<p>“Often does he apply his hands to the work, to try whether it is a
<i>human</i> body, or whether it is ivory; and yet he does not own it to
be ivory. He gives it kisses, and fancies that they are returned, and
speaks to it, and takes hold of it, and thinks that his fingers make an
impression on the limbs which they touch, and is fearful lest a livid
mark should come on her limbs <i>when</i> pressed. And one while he
employs soft expressions, at another time he brings her presents that
are agreeable to maidens, <i>such as</i> shells, and smooth pebbles, and
little birds, and flowers of a thousand tints, and lilies, and painted
balls, and tears of the Heliades, that have fallen from the trees. He
decks her limbs, too, with clothing, and puts jewels on her fingers; he
puts, <i>too</i>, a&nbsp;long necklace on her neck. Smooth pendants hang
from her ears, and bows from her breast.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10_40" id = "tag10_40" href = "#note10_40">40</a> All things are
becoming <i>to her</i>; and she does not seem less beautiful than when
naked. He places her on coverings dyed with the Sidonian shell, and
calls her the companion of his bed, and lays down her reclining neck
upon soft feathers, as though it were sensible.</p>

<p>“A festival of Venus, much celebrated throughout all Cyprus, had
<i>now</i> come; and heifers, with snow-white necks, having their
spreading horns tipped with gold, fell, struck <i>by the axe</i>.
Frankincense, too, was smoking, when, having made his offering,
Pygmalion stood before the altar, and timorously said, ‘If ye Gods can
grant all things, let my wife be, I&nbsp;pray,’ <i>and</i> he did not
dare to say ‘this ivory maid,’ <i>but</i> ‘like to this <i>statue</i> of
ivory.’ The golden Venus, as she herself was present at her own
festival, understood what that prayer meant; and as an omen of the
Divinity being favourable, thrice was the flame kindled up, and it sent
up a tapering flame into the air. Soon as he returned, he repaired to
the image of his maiden, and, lying along the couch, he gave her kisses.
She seems to grow warm. Again he applies his mouth;
<span class = "pagenum">359</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 282-299.</span>
with his hands, too, he feels her breast. The pressed ivory becomes
soft, and losing its hardness, yields to the fingers, and gives way,
just as Hymettian wax<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_41" id = "tag10_41"
href = "#note10_41">41</a> grows soft in the sun, and being worked with
the fingers is turned into many shapes, and becomes pliable by the very
handling. While he is amazed, and is rejoicing, <i>though</i> with
apprehension, and is fearing that he is deceived; the lover again and
again touches the object of his desires with his hand. It is a
<i>real</i> body; the veins throb, when touched with the thumb.</p>

<p>“Then, indeed, the Paphian hero conceives <i>in his mind</i> the most
lavish expressions, with which to give thanks to Venus, and at length
presses lips, no <i>longer</i> fictitious, with his own lips. The
maiden, too, feels the kisses given her, and blushes; and raising her
timorous eyes towards the light <i>of day</i>, she sees at once her
lover and the heavens. The Goddess was present at the marriage which she
<i>thus</i> effected. And now, the horns of the moon having been nine
times gathered into a full orb, she brought forth Paphos; from whom the
island derived its name.”</p>

The Pygmalion here mentioned must not be mistaken for the person of the
same name, who was the brother of Dido, and king of Tyre. The story is
most probably an allegory, which was based on the fact that Pygmalion
being a man of virtuous principles, and disgusted with the vicious
conduct of the women of Cyprus, took a great deal of care in training
the mind and conduct of a young female, whom he kept at a distance from
the contact of the prevailing vices; and whom, after having recovered
her from the obdurate and rocky state to which the other females were
reduced, he made his wife, and had a son by her named Paphos; who was
said to have been the founder of the city of Cyprus, known by his
name.</p>

I&nbsp;congratulate the Ismarian matrons, and my own <i>division of
the</i> globe. I&nbsp;congratulate this land, that it is afar from those
regions which produced so great an abomination. Let the Panchæan land<a

tree was not of so much worth <i>as to be a recompense for the crime to
which it owed its origin</i>. Cupid himself denies, Myrrha, that it was
his arrows that injured thee; and he defends his torches from that
imputation; one of the three Sisters kindled <i>this flame</i> within
thee, with a Stygian firebrand and with swelling vipers. It is a crime
to hate a parent; <i>but</i> this love is a greater degree of wickedness
than hatred. On every side worthy nobles are desiring thee <i>in
marriage</i>, and throughout the whole East the youths come to the
contest for thy bed. Choose out of all these one for thyself, Myrrha, so
that, in all that number, there be not one person, <i>namely, thy
father</i>.</p>

<p>“She, indeed, is sensible <i>of her criminality</i>, and struggles
hard against her infamous passion, and says to herself, ‘Whither am I
being carried away by my feelings? What am I attempting? I&nbsp;beseech
you, O&nbsp;ye Gods, and natural affection, and ye sacred ties of

with the flocks of which he is the father; and the bird conceives by
him, from whose seed she herself was conceived. Happy they, to whom
these things are allowed! The care of man has provided harsh laws, and
what Nature permits, malignant ordinances forbid. <i>And</i> yet there
are said to be nations<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_44" id = "tag10_44"

by a twofold passion. Ah, wretched me! that it was not my chance to be
born there, <i>and that</i> I am injured by my lot <i>being cast</i> in
this place! <i>but</i> why do I ruminate on these things? Forbidden
hopes, begone! He is deserving to be beloved, but as a father
<i>only</i>. Were I not, therefore, the daughter of the great Cinyras,
with Cinyras I might be united. Now, because he is so much mine, he is
not mine, and his very nearness <i>of relationship</i> is my
misfortune.</p>

<p>“‘A stranger, I were more likely to succeed. I&nbsp;could wish to go
far away hence, and to leave my native country, so I might <i>but</i>
escape this crime. A&nbsp;fatal delusion detains me <i>thus</i> in love;
that being present, I&nbsp;may look at Cinyras, and touch him, and talk
with him, and give him kisses, if nothing more is allowed me. But canst
thou hope for anything more, impious maid? and dost thou not perceive
both how many laws, and <i>how many</i> names thou art confounding? Wilt
thou be both the rival of thy mother, and the harlot of thy father? Wilt
thou be called the sister of thy son, and the mother of thy brother? and
wilt thou not dread the Sisters that have black snakes for their hair,
whom guilty minds see threatening their eyes and their faces with their
relentless torches? But do not thou conceive criminality in thy mind, so
long as thou hast suffered none in body, and violate not the laws of
all-powerful Nature by forbidden embraces. Suppose he were to be
compliant, the action itself forbids <i>thee; but</i> he is virtuous,
and regardful of what is right. And <i>yet</i>, O&nbsp;that there were a
like infatuation in him!’</p>

<p>“<i>Thus</i> she says; but Cinyras, whom an honourable crowd of
suitors is causing to be in doubt what he is to do, inquires of herself,
as he repeats their names, of which husband she would
<span class = "pagenum">362</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 358-389.</span>
wish <i>to be the wife</i>. At first she is silent; and, fixing her eyes
upon her father’s countenance, she is in confusion, and fills her eyes
with the warm tears. Cinyras, supposing this to be <i>the effect</i> of
virgin bashfulness, bids her not weep, and dries her cheeks, and gives
her kisses. On these being given, Myrrha is too much delighted; and,
being questioned what sort of a husband she would have, she says, ‘One
like thyself.’ But he praises the answer not <i>really</i><a class =
"tag" name = "tag10_45" id = "tag10_45" href = "#note10_45">45</a>
understood by him, and says, ‘Ever be thus affectionate.’ On mention
being made of affection, the maiden, conscious of her guilt, fixed her
eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>“It is <i>now</i> midnight, and sleep has dispelled the cares, and
<i>has eased</i> the minds <i>of mortals</i>. But the virgin daughter of
Cinyras, kept awake, is preyed upon by an unconquerable flame, and
ruminates upon her wild desires. And one while she despairs, and at
another she resolves to try; and is both ashamed, and <i>yet</i> is
desirous, and is not certain what she is to do; and, just as a huge
tree, wounded by the axe, when the last stroke <i>now</i> remains, is in
doubt, <i>as it were</i>, on which side it is to fall, and is dreaded in
each direction; so does her mind, shaken by varying passions, waver in
uncertainty, this way and that, and receives an impulse in either
direction; <i>and</i> no limit or repose is found for her love, but
death: ’tis death that pleases her. She raises herself upright, and
determines to insert her neck<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_46" id =
"tag10_46" href = "#note10_46">46</a> in a halter; and tying her girdle
to the top of the door-post, she says, ‘Farewell, dear Cinyras, and
understand the cause of my death;’ and <i>then</i> fits the noose to her
pale neck.</p>

<p>“They say that the sound of her words reached the attentive ears of
her nurse,<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘74’"><a class =

as she was guarding the door of her foster-child. The old woman rises,
and opens the door; and, seeing the instruments of the death she has
contemplated, at the same moment she cries aloud, and smites herself,
and rends her bosom, and snatching the girdle from her neck, tears it to
pieces. <i>And</i> then, at last, she has time to weep, then to give her
embraces, and to inquire into the occasion for the halter. The maid is
silent, <i>as</i>
<span class = "pagenum">363</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 389-422.</span>
<i>though</i> dumb, and, without moving, looks upon the earth; and
<i>thus</i> detected, is sorry for her attempt at death in this slow
manner. The old woman <i>still</i> urges her; and laying bare her grey
hair, and her withered breasts, begs her, by her cradle and by her first
nourishment, to entrust her with that which is causing her grief. She,
turning from her as she asks, heaves a sigh. The nurse is determined to
find it out, and not to promise her fidelity only. ‘Tell me,’ says she,
‘and allow me to give thee assistance; my old age is not an inactive
one. If it is a frantic passion, I&nbsp;have the means of curing it with
charms and herbs; if any one has hurt thee by spells, by magic rites
shalt thou be cured; or if it is the anger of the Gods, that anger can
be appeased by sacrifice. What more <i>than these</i> can I think of? No
doubt thy fortunes and thy family are prosperous, and in the way of
continuing so; thy mother and thy father are <i>still</i> surviving.’
Myrrha, on hearing her father’s <i>name</i>, heaves a sigh from the
bottom of her heart. Nor, even yet, does her nurse apprehend in her mind
any unlawful passion; <i>and</i> still she has a presentiment that it is
something <i>connected with</i> love. Persisting in her purpose, she
entreats her, whatever it is, to disclose it to her, and takes her, as
she weeps, in her aged lap; and so embracing her in her feeble arms, she
says, ‘Daughter, I&nbsp;understand it; thou art in love, and in this
case (lay aside thy fears) my assiduity will be of service to thee; nor
shall thy father ever be aware of it.’</p>

<p>“Furious, she sprang away from her bosom; and pressing the bed with
her face, she said, ‘Depart, I&nbsp;entreat thee, and spare my wretched
shame.’ Upon the other insisting, she said, ‘Either depart, or cease to
inquire why it is I grieve; that which thou art striving to know, is
impious.’ The old woman is struck with horror, and stretches forth her
hands palsied both with years and with fear, and suppliantly falls
before the feet of her foster-child. And one while she soothes her,
sometimes she terrifies her <i>with the consequences</i>, if she is not
made acquainted with it; and <i>then</i> she threatens her with the
discovery of the halter, <i>and</i> of her attempted destruction, and
promises her good offices, if the passion is confided to her. She lifts
up her head, and fills the breast of her nurse with tears bursting
forth; and often endeavouring to confess, as often does she check her
voice; and she covers her blushing face with her garments, and says, ‘O,
mother, happy in thy husband!’
<span class = "pagenum">364</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 423-434.</span>
Thus much <i>she says</i>; and <i>then</i> she sighs. A&nbsp;trembling
shoots through the chilled limbs and the bones of her nurse, for she
understands her; and her white hoariness stands bristling with stiff
hair all over her head; and she adds many a word to drive away a passion
so dreadful, if <i>only</i> she can. But the maiden is well aware that
she is not advised to a false step; still she is resolved to die, if she
does not enjoy him whom she loves. ‘Live <i>then</i>,’ says <i>the
nurse</i>, ‘thou shalt enjoy thy&mdash;&mdash;’ and, not daring to say
‘parent,’ she is silent; and <i>then</i> she confirms her promise with
an oath.</p>

they reckon embraces, and the contact of a husband, among the things
forbidden. Cenchreïs, the king’s wife, is absent in that company, and
attends the mysterious rites. Therefore, while his bed is without his
lawful wife, the nurse, wickedly industrious, having found Cinyras
overcome with wine, discloses to him a real passion, <i>but</i> under a
feigned name, and praises the beauty <i>of the damsel</i>. On his
enquiring the age of the maiden, she says, ‘She is of the same age as
Myrrha.’ After she is commanded to bring her, and as soon as she has
returned home, she says, ‘Rejoice, my fosterling, we have prevailed.’
The unhappy maid does not feel joy throughout her entire body, and her
boding breast is sad. And still she does rejoice: so great is the
discord in her mind.</p>

approaches to <i>perpetrate</i> her enormity. The golden moon flies from
the heavens; black clouds conceal the hiding stars; the night is
deprived of its fires. Thou, Icarus, dost conceal thy rising
countenance; and <i>thou</i>, Erigone, raised to the heavens through thy
affectionate love for thy father. Three times was she recalled by the
presage of her foot stumbling; thrice did the funereal owl give an omen
by its dismal cry. Yet <i>onward</i> she goes, and the gloom and the
dark night lessen her shame. In her left hand she holds that of her
nurse, the other, by groping, explores the secret road. <i>And</i> now
she is arrived at the door of the chamber; and now she opens the door;
now she is led in; but her knees tremble beneath her sinking hams, her
colour and her blood vanish; and her courage deserts her as she moves
along. The nearer she is to <i>the commission of</i> her crime, the more
she dreads it, and she repents of her attempt, and could wish to be able
to return unknown. The old woman leads her on by the hand as she
lingers, and when she has delivered her up on her approach to the lofty
bed, she says, ‘Take her, Cinyras, she is thy

own,’ and <i>so</i> unites their doomed bodies. The father receives his
own bowels into the polluted bed, and allays her virgin fears, and
encourages her as she trembles. Perhaps, too, he may have called her by
a name <i>suited to</i> her age, and she may have called him ‘father,’
that the <i>appropriate</i> names might not be wanting in this deed of
horror. Pregnant by her father, she departs from the chamber, and, in
her impiety, bears his seed in her incestuous womb, and carries <i>with
her</i>, criminality in her conception. The ensuing night repeats the
guilty deed; nor on that <i>night</i> is there an end. At last, Cinyras,
after so many embraces, longing to know who is his paramour, on lights
being brought in, discovers both the crime and his own daughter.</p>

<p>“His words checked through grief, he draws his shining sword from the
scabbard as it hangs. Myrrha flies, rescued from death by the gloom and
the favour of a dark night; and wandering along the wide fields, she
leaves the Arabians famed for their palms, and the Panchæan fields. And
she wanders during nine horns of the returning moon; when, at length,
being weary, she rests in the Sabæan country,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10_50" id = "tag10_50" href = "#note10_50">50</a> and with
difficulty she supports the burden of her womb. Then, uncertain what to
wish, and between the fear of death and weariness of life, she uttered
such a prayer <i>as this</i>: ‘O&nbsp;ye Deities, if any of you favour those
who are penitent; I&nbsp;have deserved severe punishment, and I do not
shrink from it. But that, neither existing, I&nbsp;may pollute the
living, nor dead, those who are departed, expel me from both these
realms; and transforming me, deny me both life and death.’ <i>Some</i>
Divinity <i>ever</i> regards the penitent; at least, the last of her
prayers found its Gods <i>to execute it</i>. For the earth closes over
her legs as she speaks, and a root shoots forth obliquely through her
bursting nails, <i>as</i> a firm support to her tall trunk. Her bones,
too, become hard wood, and her marrow continuing in the middle, her
blood changes into sap, her arms into great branches, her fingers into
smaller ones; her skin grows hard with bark. And now the growing tree
has run over her heavy womb, and has covered her breast, and
<span class = "pagenum">367</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 496-518.</span>
is ready to enclose her neck. She cannot endure delay, and sinks down to
meet the approaching wood, and hides her features within the bark.
Though she has lost her former senses together with her <i>human</i>
shape, she still weeps on, and warm drops distil<a class = "tag" name =
"tag10_51" id = "tag10_51" href = "#note10_51">51</a> from the tree.
There is a value even in her tears, and the myrrh distilling from the
bark, retains the name of its mistress, and will be unheard-of in no
<i>future</i> age.</p>

<p>“But the infant conceived in guilt grows beneath the wood, and seeks
out a passage, by which he may extricate himself, having left his
mother. Her pregnant womb swells in the middle of the tree. The burden
distends the mother, nor have her pangs words of their own <i>whereby to
express themselves</i>; nor can Lucina be invoked by her voice
<i>while</i> bringing forth. Yet she is like one struggling <i>to be
delivered</i>; and the bending tree utters frequent groans, and is
moistened with falling tears. Gentle Lucina stands by the moaning
boughs, and applies her hands, and utters words that promote delivery.
The tree gapes open, in chinks, and through the cleft bark it discharges
the living burden. The child cries; the Naiads, laying him on the soft
grass, anoint him with the tears of his mother.</p>

<p>“Even Envy <i>herself</i> would have commended his face; for just as

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Le Clerc, forming his ideas on what Lucian, Phurnutus, and other authors
have said on the subject, explains the story of Cinyras and Myrrha in
the following manner. Cynnor, or Cinyras, the grandfather of Adonis,
having one day drank to excess, fell asleep in a posture which violated
the rules of decency. Mor, or Myrrha, his daughter-in-law, the wife of
Ammon, together with her son Adonis, seeing him in that condition,
acquainted her husband with her father’s lapse. On his repeating this to
Cinyras, the latter was so full of indignation, that he loaded Myrrha
and Adonis with imprecations.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Loaded with the execrations of her father, Myrrha retired into Arabia,
where she remained some time; and because Adonis passed some portion
<span class = "pagenum">368</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 519-525.</span>
of his youth there, the poets feigned that Myrrha was delivered of him
in that country. Her transformation into a tree was only invented on
account of the equivocal character of her name, ‘Mor,’ which meant in
the Arabic language ‘Myrrh.’ It is very probable that the story was
founded on a tradition among the Phœnicians of the history of Noah, and
of the malediction which Ham drew on himself by his undutiful conduct
towards his father.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Adonis</span> is educated by the Naiads. His
beauty makes a strong impression on the Goddess Venus, and, in her
passion, she traverses the same wilds in pursuit of the youth, which his
mother did, when flying from the wrath of her father. After chasing the
wild beasts, she invites Adonis to a poplar shade, where she warns him
of his danger in hunting lions, wild boars, and such formidable animals.
On this occasion, too, she relates the adventures of Hippomenes and
Atalanta. The beauty of the latter was such, that her charms daily
attracted crowds of suitors. Having consulted the oracle, whether she
shall marry, she is answered that a husband will certainly prove her
destruction. On this, to avoid marrying, she makes it a rule to offer to
run with her suitors, promising that she herself will be the prize of
the victor, but only on condition that immediate death shall be the fate
of those who are vanquished by her. As she excels in running, her design
succeeds, and several suitors die in the attempt to win her. Hippomenes,
smitten with her charms, is not daunted at their ill success; but boldly
enters the lists, after imploring the aid of Venus. Atalanta is struck
with his beauty, and is much embarrassed, whether she shall yield to the
charms of the youth, or to the dissuasions of the oracle. Hippomenes
attracts her attention in the race, by throwing down some golden apples
which Venus has given him, and then, reaching the goal before her, he
carries off the reward of victory. Venus, to punish his subsequent
ingratitude towards her, raises his desires to such a pitch, that he
incurs the resentment of Cybele, by defiling her shrine with the
embraces of his mistress; on which they are both transformed into lions,
and thenceforth draw the chariot of the Goddess.</p>

<p>“Winged time glides on insensibly and deceives us; and there is
nothing more fleeting than years. He, born of his own sister and of his
grandfather, who, so lately enclosed in a tree, was so lately born, and
but just now a most beauteous infant, is now a youth, now a man,
<i>and</i> now more beauteous than he <i>was before</i>. <i>And</i> now
he pleases even Venus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_52" id = "tag10_52"

<i>kindled by her</i>. For, while the boy that wears the quiver is
giving kisses to his mother, he
<span class = "pagenum">369</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 526-556.</span>
unconsciously grazes her breast with a protruding arrow. The Goddess,
wounded, pushed away her son with her hand. The wound was inflicted more
deeply than it seemed to be, and at first had deceived <i>even</i>
herself. Charmed with the beauty of the youth, she does not now care for
the Cytherian shores, nor does she revisit Paphos, surrounded with the
deep sea, and Cnidos,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_53" id = "tag10_53"
href = "#note10_53">53</a> abounding in fish, or Amathus, rich in
metals.</p>

<p>“She abandons even the skies; him she <i>ever</i> attends; and she
who has been always accustomed to indulge in the shade, and to improve
her beauty, by taking care of it, wanders over the tops of mountains,
through the woods, and over bushy rocks, bare to the knee and with her
robes tucked up after the manner of Diana, and she cheers on the dogs,
and hunts animals that are harmless prey, either the fleet hares, or the
stag with its lofty horns, or the hinds; she keeps afar from the fierce
boars, and avoids the ravening wolves, and the bears armed with claws,
and the lions glutted with the slaughter of the herds. Thee, too,
Adonis, she counsels to fear them, if she can aught avail by advising
thee. And she says, “Be brave against those <i>animals</i> that fly;
boldness is not safe against those that are bold. Forbear, youth, to be
rash at my hazard, and attack not the wild beasts to which nature has
granted arms, lest thy <i>thirst for</i> glory should cost me dear.
Neither thy age, nor thy beauty, nor <i>other</i> things which have made
an impression on Venus, make any impression on lions and bristly boars,
and the eyes and the tempers of wild beasts. The fierce boars carry
lightning<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_54" id = "tag10_54" href =

unlimited in the tawny lions; and the <i>whole</i> race is odious
to&nbsp;me.”</p>

<p>“Upon his asking, what is the reason, she says, ‘I will tell thee,
and thou wilt be surprised at the prodigious result of a fault long
since committed. But <i>this</i> toil to which I am unaccustomed has now
fatigued me, and see! a&nbsp;convenient poplar invites us, by its shade,
and the turf furnishes a couch. Here I am desirous to repose myself,
together with
<span class = "pagenum">370</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 556-592.</span>
thee;’ and <i>forthwith</i> she rests herself on the ground, and presses
at once the grass and himself. And with her neck reclining on the bosom
of the youth, smiling, she thus says, and she mingles kisses in the
midst of her words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Perhaps thou mayst have heard how a certain damsel excelled the
swiftest men in the contest of speed. That report was no idle tale; for
she did excel them. Nor couldst thou have said, whether she was more
distinguished in the merit of her swiftness, or in the excellence of her
beauty. Upon her consulting the oracle about a husband, the God said to
her, ‘Thou hast no need, Atalanta, of a husband; avoid obtaining a
husband. And yet thou wilt not avoid it, and, while <i>still</i> living,
thou wilt lose thyself.’ Alarmed with the response of the God, she lives
a single life in the shady woods, and determinedly repulses the pressing
multitude of her suitors with these conditions. ‘I am not,’ says she,
‘to be gained, unless first surpassed in speed. Engage with me in
running. Both a wife and a wedding shall be given as the reward of the
swift; death <i>shall be</i> the recompense of the slow. Let that be the
condition of the contest.’ She, indeed, was cruel <i>in this
proposal</i>; but (so great is the power of beauty) a&nbsp;rash
multitude of suitors agreed to these terms. Hippomenes had sat, as a
spectator, of this unreasonable race, and said, ‘Is a wife sought by any
one, amid dangers so great?’ And <i>thus</i> he condemned the excessive
ardour of the youths. <i>But</i> when he beheld her face, and her body
with her clothes laid aside, such as mine is, or such as thine would be,
<i>Adonis</i>, if thou wast to become a woman, he was astonished, and
raising his hands, he said, ‘Pardon me, ye whom I was just now
censuring; the reward which you contended for was not yet known to
me.’</p>

<p>“In commending her, he kindles the flame, and wishes that none of the
young men may run more swiftly than she, and, in his envy, is
apprehensive of it. ‘But why,’ says he, ‘is my chance in this contest
left untried? The Divinity himself assists the daring.’ While Hippomenes
is pondering such things within himself, the virgin flies with winged
pace. Although she appears to the Aonian youth to go no less swiftly
than the Scythian arrow, he admires her still more in her beauty, and
the very speed makes her beauteous. The breeze that meets her bears back
her pinions on her swift feet, and
<span class = "pagenum">371</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 592-606.</span>
her hair is thrown over her ivory shoulders and the leggings which are
below her knees with their variegated border, and upon her virgin
whiteness her body has contracted a blush; no otherwise than as when
purple hangings<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_55" id = "tag10_55" href =
"#note10_55">55</a> over a whitened hall tint it with a shade of a
similar colour. While the stranger is observing these things, the last
course is run,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_56" id = "tag10_56" href =
"#note10_56">56</a> and the victorious Atalanta is adorned with a
festive crown. The vanquished utter sighs, and pay the penalty,
according to the stipulation. Still, not awed by the end of these young
men, he stands up in the midst; and fixing his eyes on the maiden, he
says, ‘Why dost thou seek an easy victory by conquering the inactive?
Contend <i>now</i> with me. If fortune shall render me victorious, thou
wilt not take it ill to be conquered by one so illustrious. For my
father was Megareus, Onchestius his;<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_57"
id = "tag10_57" href = "#note10_57">57</a> Neptune was his grandsire;
I&nbsp;am
<span class = "pagenum">372</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 606-636.</span>
the great grandson of the king of the waves. Nor is my merit inferior to
my extraction. Or if I shall be conquered, in the conquest of Hippomenes
thou wilt have a great and honourable name.’</p>

<p>“As he utters such words as these, the daughter of Schœneus regards
him with a benign countenance, and is in doubt whether she shall wish to
be overcome or to conquer; and thus she says: ‘What Deity, a&nbsp;foe to
the beauteous, wishes to undo this <i>youth</i>? and commands him, at
the risk of a life <i>so</i> dear, to seek this alliance? In my own
opinion, I&nbsp;am not of so great value. Nor <i>yet</i> am I moved by
his beauty. Still, by this, too, I&nbsp;could be moved. But, <i>’tis</i>
because he is still a boy; ’tis not himself that affects me, but his
age. And is it not, too, because he has courage and a mind undismayed by
death? And is it not, besides, because he is reckoned fourth in descent
from the <i>monarch</i> of the sea? And is it not, because he loves me,
and thinks a marriage with me of so much worth as to perish <i>for
it</i>, if cruel fortune should deny me to him? Stranger, while
<i>still</i> thou mayst, begone, and abandon an alliance stained with
blood. A&nbsp;match with me is cruelly hazardous. No woman will be
unwilling to be married to thee; and thou mayst be desired <i>even</i>
by a prudent maid. But why have I any concern for thee, when so many
have already perished? Let him look to it; <i>and</i> let him die, since
he is not warned by the fate of so many of my wooers, and is impelled
onwards to weariness of life.</p>

<p>“‘Shall he then die because he was desirous with me to live? And
shall he suffer an undeserved death, the reward of his love? My victory
will not be able to support the odium <i>of the deed</i>. But it is no
fault of mine. I&nbsp;wish thou wouldst desist! or since thou art
<i>thus</i> mad, would that thou wast more fleet <i>than I!</i> But what
a feminine look<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_58" id = "tag10_58" href =
"#note10_58">58</a> there is in his youthful face! Ah, wretched
Hippomenes, I&nbsp;would that I had not been seen by thee! Thou wast
worthy to have lived! And if I had been more fortunate; and if the
vexatious Divinities had not denied me <i>the blessings of</i> marriage,
thou wast one with whom I could have shared my bed.’ Thus she said; and
as one inexperienced, and smitten by Cupid for the first
<span class = "pagenum">373</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 636-669.</span>
time, not knowing what she is doing, she is in love, and <i>yet</i> does
not know that she is in love.</p>

<p>“<i>And</i> now, both the people and her father, demanded the usual
race, when Hippomenes, the descendant of Neptune, invoked me with
anxious voice; ‘I entreat that Cytherea may favour my undertaking, and
aid the passion that she has inspired <i>in me</i>.’ The breeze, not
envious, wafted to me this tender prayer; I&nbsp;was moved,
I&nbsp;confess it; nor was any long delay made in <i>giving</i> aid.
There is a field, the natives call it by name the Tamasenian
<i>field</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag10_59" id = "tag10_59" href =
"#note10_59">59</a> the choicest spot in the Cyprian land; this the
elders of former days consecrated to me, and ordered to be added as an
endowment for my temple. In the middle of this field a tree flourishes,
with yellow foliage, <i>and</i> with branches tinkling with yellow gold.
Hence, by chance as I was coming, I&nbsp;carried three golden apples,
that I had plucked, in my hand; and being visible to none but him,
I&nbsp;approached Hippomenes, and I showed him what <i>was to be</i> the
use of them. The trumpets have <i>now</i> given the signal, when each
<i>of them</i> darts precipitately from the starting place, and skims
the surface of the sand with nimble feet. You might have thought them
able to pace the sea with dry feet, and to run along the ears of white
standing corn <i>while</i> erect. The shouts and the applause of the
populace give courage to the youth, and the words of those who exclaim,
‘Now, now, Hippomenes, is the moment to speed onward! make haste. Now
use all thy strength! Away with delay! thou shalt be conqueror.’ It is
doubtful whether the Megarean hero, or the virgin daughter of Schœneus
rejoiced the most at these sayings. O&nbsp;how often when she could have
passed by him, did she slacken her speed, and <i>then</i> unwillingly
left behind the features that long she had gazed upon.</p>

<p>“A parched panting is coming from his faint mouth, and the goal is
<i>still</i> a great way off. Then, at length, the descendant of Neptune
throws one of the three products of the tree. The virgin is amazed, and
from a desire for the shining fruit, she turns from her course, and
picks up the rolling gold. Hippomenes passes her. The theatres ring<a
class = "tag" name = "tag10_60" id = "tag10_60" href =
"#note10_60">60</a> with applause. She
<span class = "pagenum">374</span>
<span class = "linenum">x. 669-701.</span>
makes amends for her delay, and the time that she has lost, with a swift
pace, and again she leaves the youth behind. And, retarded by the
throwing of a second apple, again she overtakes the <i>young</i> man,
and passes by him. The last part of the race <i>now</i> remained.
‘<i>And</i> now,’ said he, ‘O Goddess, giver of this present, aid me;’
and <i>then</i> with youthful might, he threw the shining gold, in an
oblique direction, on one side of the plain, in order that she might
return the more slowly. The maiden seemed to be in doubt, whether she
should fetch it; I&nbsp;forced her to take it up, and added weight to
the apple, when she had taken it up, and I impeded her, both by the
heaviness of the burden, and the delay in reaching it. And that my
narrative may not be more tedious than that race, the virgin was outrun,
and the conqueror obtained the prize.</p>

<p>“And was I not, Adonis, deserving that he should return thanks to me,
and the tribute of frankincense? but, in his ingratitude, he gave me
neither thanks nor frankincense. I&nbsp;was thrown into a sudden
passion; and provoked at being slighted, I&nbsp;provided by
<i>making</i> an example, that I should not be despised in future times,
and I aroused myself against them both. They were passing by a temple,
concealed within a shady wood, which the famous Echion had formerly
built for the Mother of the Gods, according to his vow; and the length
of their journey moved them to take rest <i>there</i>. There, an
unseasonable desire of caressing <i>his wife</i> seized Hippomenes,
excited by my agency. Near the temple was a recess, with <i>but</i>
little light, like a cave, covered with native pumice stone, <i>one</i>
sacred from ancient religious observance; where the priest had conveyed
many a wooden image of the ancient Gods. This he entered, and he defiled
the sanctuary by a forbidden crime. The sacred images turned away their
eyes, and the Mother <i>of the Gods</i>, crowned with turrets,<a class =

<p class = "explanation">
The Atalanta who is mentioned in this story was the daughter of
Schœneus, and the granddaughter of Athamas, whose misfortunes obliged
him to retire into Bœotia, where he built a little town, which was
called after his name, as we learn from Pausanias and Eustathius. Ovid
omits to say that it was one of the conditions of the agreement, that
the lover was to have the start in the race. According to some writers,
the golden apples were from the gardens of the Hesperides; while,
according to others, they were plucked by Venus in the isle of Cyprus.
The story seems to be founded merely on the fact, that Hippomenes
contrived by means of bribes to find the way to the favour of his
mistress.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Apollodorus, however, relates the story in a different manner; he says
that the father of Atalanta desiring to have sons, but no daughters,
exposed her, on her birth, in a desert, that she might perish.
A&nbsp;she-bear found the infant, and nourished it, until it was
discovered by some hunters. As the damsel grew up, she made hunting her
favourite pursuit, and slew two Centaurs, who offered her violence, with
her arrows. On her parents pressing her to marry, she consented to be
the wife of that man only who could outrun her, on condition that those
who were conquered by her in the race should be put to death. Several of
her suitors having failed in the attempt, one of the name of Melanion,
by using a similar stratagem to that attributed by Ovid to Hippomenes,
conquered her in the race, and became her husband. Having profaned the
temple of Jupiter, they were transformed, Melanion into a lion, and
Atalanta into a lioness. According to Apollodorus, her father’s name was

have been different personages. Euripides makes Mænalus to have been the

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Theocritus, Bion, Hyginus, and Antoninus Liberalis, beside several other
authors, relate the history of the loves of Venus and Adonis. They
inform us of many particulars which Ovid has here neglected to remark.
They say that Mars, jealous of the passion which Venus had for Adonis,
implored the aid of Diana, who, to gratify his revenge, sent the boar
that destroyed the youth. According to some writers, it was Apollo
himself that took the form of that animal; and they say that Adonis
descending to the Infernal Regions, Proserpine fell in love with him,
and refused to allow him to return, notwithstanding the orders of
Jupiter. On this, the king of heaven fearing to displease both the
Goddesses, referred the dispute to the Muse Calliope, who directed that
Adonis should pass one half of his time with Venus on earth, and the
other half in the Infernal Regions. They also tell us that it took up a
year before the dispute could be determined, and that the Hours brought
Adonis at last to the upper world, on which, Venus being dissatisfied
with the decision of Calliope, instigated the women of Thrace to kill
her son Orpheus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The mythologists have considered this story to be based on grounds
either historical or physical. Cicero, in his Discourse on the Nature of
the Gods, says, that there were several persons who had the name of
Venus, and that the fourth, surnamed Astarte, was a Syrian, who married
Adonis, the son of Cinyras, king of Cyprus. Hunting in the forests of
Mount Libanus, or Lebanon, he was wounded in the groin by a wild boar,
which accident ultimately caused his death. Astarte caused the city of
Byblos and all Syria to mourn for his loss; and, to keep his name and
his sad fate in remembrance, established feasts in his honour, to be
celebrated each year. Going still further, if we suppose the story to
have originated in historical facts, it seems not improbable that Adonis
did not die of his wound, and that, contrary to all expectation, he was
cured; as the Syrians, after having mourned for several days during his
festival, rejoiced as though he had been raised from the dead, at a
second festival called ‘The Return.’ The worship both of Venus and
Adonis probably originated in Syria, and was spread through Asia Minor
into Greece; while the Carthaginians, a&nbsp;Phœnician colony introduced
it into Sicily. The festival of Adonis is most amusingly described by
Theocritus the Sicilian poet, in his ‘Adoniazusæ.’ Some authors have
suggested that Adonis was the same with the Egyptian God Osiris, and
that the affliction
<span class = "pagenum">378</span>
of Venus represented that of Isis at the death of her husband. According
to Hesiod, Adonis was the son of Phœnix and Alphesibœa, while Panyasis
says that he was son of Theias, the king of the Assyrians.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
In support of the view which some commentators take of the story of
Adonis having been founded on physical circumstance, we cannot do better
than quote the able remarks of Mr. Keightley on the subject. He says
(Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy, p. 109)&mdash; “The tale of
Adonis is apparently an Eastern mythus. His very name is Semitic (Hebrew
‘Adon,’ ‘Lord’), and those of his parents also refer to that part of the
world. He appears to be the same with the Thammuz, mentioned by the
prophet Ezekiel, and to be a Phœnician personification of the sun who,
during a part of the year is absent, or, as the legend expresses it,
with the Goddess of the under world: during the remainder with Astarte,
the regent of heaven. It is uncertain when the Adonia were first
celebrated in Greece; but we find Plato alluding to the gardens of
Adonis, as boxes of flowers used in them were called; and the ill
fortune of the Athenian expedition to Sicily was in part ascribed to the
circumstance of the fleet having sailed during that festival<ins class =
"correction" title = "close quote missing">.”</ins></p>

<p class = "explanation">
<ins class = "correction" title = "misplaced open quote">This</ins>
notion of the mourning for Adonis being a testimony of grief for the
absence of the Sun during the winter, is not, however, to be too readily
acquiesced in. Lobeck (Aglaophamus, p.&nbsp;691), for example, asks,
with some appearance of reason, why those nations whose heaven was
mildest, and their winter shortest, should so bitterly bewail the
regular changes of the seasons, as to feign that the Gods themselves
were carried off or slain; and he shrewdly observes, that, in that case,
the mournful and the joyful parts of the festival should have been held
at different times of the year, and not joined together, as they were.
He further inquires, whether the ancient writers, who esteemed these
Gods to be so little superior to men, may not have believed them to have
been really and not metaphorically put to death? And, in truth, it is
not easy to give a satisfactory answer to these questions.</p>

<i>Studded with gems.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 113. Necklaces were much worn in
ancient times by the Indians, Persians, and Egyptians. They were more
especially used by the Greek and Roman females as bridal ornaments. The
‘monile baccatum,’ or ‘bead necklace,’ was the most common, being made
of berries, glass, or other materials, strung together. They were so
strung with thread, silk, or wire, and links of gold. Emeralds seem to
have been much used for this purpose, and amber was also similarly
employed. Thus Ovid says, in the second Book of the Metamorphoses, line
366, that the amber distilled from the trees, into which the sisters of
Phaëton were changed, was sent to be worn by the Latian matrons. Horses
and favourite animals, as in the present instance, were decked with
‘monilia,’ or necklaces.</p>

<i>A silver ball.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 114. The ‘bulla’ was a ball of metal,
so called from its resemblance in shape to a bubble of water. These were
especially worn by the Roman children, suspended from the neck, and were
mostly made of thin plates of gold, being of about the size of a walnut.
The use of these ornaments was derived from the people of Etruria; and
though originally worn only by the children of the Patricians, they were
subsequently used by all of free birth. The children of the Libertini,
or ‘freedmen,’ indeed wore ‘bullæ,’ but they were only made of leather.
The ‘bulla’ was laid aside at the same time as the ‘toga prætexta,’ and
was on that occasion consecrated to the Lares. The bulls of the Popes of
Rome, received their names from this word; the ornament which was
pendent from the rescript or decree being used to signify the document
itself.</p>

by the Romans ‘inauris.’ The Greeks also called it <span class = "greek"
title = "ellobion">ἐλλόβιον</span>, from its being inserted in the lobe
of the ear. Earrings were worn by both sexes among the Lydians,
Persians, Libyans, Carthaginians, and other nations. Among the Greeks
and Romans, the females alone were in the habit of wearing them. As with
us, the ear-ring consisted of a ring and drop, the ring being generally
of gold, though bronze was sometimes used by the common people. Pearls,
especially those of elongated form, which were called ‘elenchi,’ were
very much valued for pendants.</p>

<i>Who are sorrowing.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 142. The Poet in this manner
accounts for the Roman custom of placing branches of Cypress before the
doors of houses in which a dead body lay. Pliny the Elder says, that the
Cypress was sacred to Pluto, and that for that reason it was used at
funerals, and was placed upon the pile. Varro says, that it was used for
the purpose of removing, by its own strong scent, the bad smell of the
spot where the bodies were burnt, and also of the bodies themselves. It
was also said to be so used, because, when once its bark is cut, it
withers, and is consequently emblematical of the frail tenure of human
life.</p>

Phlegræan <i>plains</i> near Cumæ, in Italy, and say that in a spot near
there, much impregnated with sulphur, Jupiter, aided by Hercules and the
other Deities, conquered the Giants with his lightnings. Others say that
their locality was in that part of Macedonia which was afterwards called
Pallene; others again, in Thessaly, or Thrace.</p>

<i>Carry his bolts.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 158. The eagle was feigned to be the
attendant bird of Jove, among other reasons, because it was supposed to
fly higher than any other bird, to be able to fix its gaze on the sun
without being dazzled, and never to receive injury from lightning. It
was also said to have been the armour-bearer of Jupiter in his wars
against the Titans, and to have carried his thunderbolts.</p>

<i>Descendant of Amycla.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 162. Hyacinthus is here called
Amyclides, as though being the son of Amycla, whereas, in line 196 he is
called ‘Œbalides,’ as though the son of Œbalus. Pausamas and Apollodorus
(in one instance) say that he was the son of Amycla, the Lacedæmonian,
who founded the city of Amyclæ; though, in another place, Apollodorus
says that Piërus was his father. On the other hand, Hyginus, Lucian, and
Servius say that he was the son of Œbalus. Some explain ‘Amyclide,’ as
meaning ‘born at Amyclæ;’ and, indeed, Claudian says that he was born
there. Others, again, would have Œbalide to signify ‘born at Œbalia.’
But, if he was the son of Amycla, this could not be the signification,
as Œbalia was founded by Œbalus, who was the grandson of Amycla. The
poet, most probably, meant to style him the descendant of Amycla, as
being his great grandson, and the son of Œbalus. Again, in the 217th
line of this Book, the Poet says that he was born at Sparta; but, in the
fifth Book of the Fasti, line 223, he mentions Therapnæ, a&nbsp;town of
Laconia, as having been his birthplace. Perizonius thinks that Ovid has
here inadvertently confounded the different versions of the story of
Hyacinthus.</p>

<i>In the middle.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 168. Delphi, situated on a ridge of
Parnassus, was styled the navel of the world, as it was supposed to be

let go two eagles, or pigeons, at the opposite extremities of the earth,
with the view of ascertaining the central spot of it, they met in their

ancients, was made of brass, iron, stone, or wood, and was about ten or

spherical form, was thrown instead of the ‘discus.’ It was perforated in
the middle, and a rope or thong being passed through, was used in

<i>Hyacinthian festival.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 219. The Hyacinthia was a
festival celebrated every year at Amyclæ, in Laconia, by the people of
that town and of Sparta. Some writers say that it was held solely in
honour of Apollo; others, of Hyacinthus; but it is much more probable,
that it was intended to be in honour of both Apollo and Hyacinthus. The
festival lasted for three days, and began on the longest day of the
Spartan month, Hecatombæus. On the first and last day, sacrifices were
offered to the dead, and the fate of Hyacinthus was lamented. Garlands
were forbidden to be worn on those days, bread was not allowed to be
eaten, and no songs were recited in praise of Apollo. On the second day,
rejoicing and amusements prevailed; the praises of Apollo were sung, and
horse races were celebrated; after which, females, riding in chariots
made of wicker-work, and splendidly adorned, formed a beautiful
procession. On this day, sacrifices were offered, and the citizens kept
open houses for their friends and relations. Athenæus mentions a
favourite meal of the Laconians on this occasion, which was called <span
class = "greek" title = "kopis">κοπίς</span>, and consisted of cakes,
bread, meat, broth, raw herbs, figs, and other fruits, with the seeds of
the lupine. Macrobius says, that chaplets of ivy were worn at the
Hyacinthia; but, of course, that remark can only apply to the second
day. Even when they had taken the field against an enemy, the people of
Amyclæ were in the habit of returning home on the approach of the
Hyacinthia, to celebrate that festival.</p>

<i>Festival of Ceres.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 431. Commentators, in general,
suppose that he here alludes to the festival of the Thesmophoria, which
was celebrated in honour of Demeter, or Ceres, in various parts of
Greece; in general, by the married women, though the virgins joined in
some of the ceremonies. Demosthenes, Diodorus Siculus, and Plutarch, say
that it was first celebrated by Orpheus; while Herodotus states, that it
was introduced from Egypt by the daughters of Danaüs; and that, after
the Dorian conquest, it fell into disuse, being retained only by the
people of Arcadia. It was intended to commemorate the introduction of
laws and the regulations of civilized life, which were generally
ascribed to Demeter. It is not known whether <ins class = "correction"
title = "e invisible">the</ins> festival lasted four or five days with
the Athenians. Many days were spent by the matrons in preparing for its
celebration. The solemnity was commenced by the women walking in
procession from Athens to Eleusis. In this procession they carried on
their heads representations of the laws which had been introduced by
Ceres, and other symbols of civilized life. They then spent the night at
Eleusis, in celebrating the mysteries of the Goddess. The second day was
one of mourning, during which the women sat on the ground around the
statues of Ceres, taking no food but cakes made of sesame and honey. On
it no meetings of the people were held. Probably it was in the afternoon
of this day that there was a procession at Athens, in which the women
walked bare-footed behind a waggon, upon which were baskets, with sacred
symbols. The third day was one of merriment and festivity among the
women, in commemoration of Iämbe, who was said to have amused the
Goddess during her grief at the loss of Proserpine. An atoning
sacrifice, called <span class = "greek" title = "zêmia">ζήμια</span>,
was probably offered to the Goddess, at the end of this day. It is most
probable that the ceremonial lasted but three days. The women wore white
dresses during the period of its performance, and they adopted the same
colour during the celebration of the Cerealia at Rome. Burmann thinks,
that an Eastern festival, in honour of Ceres, is here referred to. If
so, no accounts of it whatever have come down to us.</p>

<i>Among the Triones.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 446. ‘Triones’. This word, which
is applied to the stars of the Ursa Major, or Charles’s Wain, literally
means ‘oxen;’ and is by some thought to come from ‘tero,’ ‘to bruise,’
because oxen were used for the purpose of threshing corn; but it is more
likely to have its origin from ‘terra,’ ‘the earth,’ because oxen were
used for ploughing. The Poet employs this periphrasis, to signify the
middle of the night.</p>

Arabia Felix, now called ‘Yemen.’ It was famed for its myrrh,
frankincense, and spices. In the Scriptures it is called Sheba, and it
was the queen of this region, who came to listen to the wisdom of
Solomon.</p>

which frankincense is produced, it exuding from the bark of the tree in
drops; this gum, Pliny the Elder and Lucretius call by the name of
‘stacta,’ or ‘stacte.’ The ancients flavoured their wines with
myrrh.</p>

<i>Purple hangings.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 595. Curtains, or hangings, called
‘aulæa,’ were used by the ancients to ornament their halls, sitting
rooms, and bed chambers. In private houses they were also sometimes hung
as coverings over doors, and in the interior, as substitutes for them.
In the palace of the Roman emperors, a&nbsp;slave, called ‘velarius,’
was posted at each of the principal doors, to raise the curtain when any
one passed through. Window curtains were also used by the Romans, while
they were employed in the temples, to veil the statue of the Divinity.
Ovid here speaks of them as being of purple colour; while Lucretius
mentions them as being of yellow, red, and rusty hue.</p>

<p><a name = "note10_56" id = "note10_56" href = "#tag10_56">56.</a>
<i>Last course is run.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 597. Among the Romans, the race
consisted of seven rounds of the Circus, or rather circuits of the
‘spina,’ or wall, in the midst of it, at each end of which was the
‘meta,’ or goal. Livy and Dio Cassius speak of seven conical balls,
resembling eggs, which were called ‘ova,’ and were placed upon the
‘spina.’ Their use was to enable the spectators to count the number of
rounds which had been run, for which reason they were seven in number;
and as each round was run, one of the ‘ova’ was put up, or, according to
Varro, taken down. The form of the egg was adopted in honour of Castor
and Pollux, who were said to have been produced from eggs. The words
‘novissima meta’ here mean either ‘the last part of the course,’ or,
possibly, ‘the last time round the course.’</p>

<i>Onchestius his.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 605. But Hyginus says that Neptune
was the father of Megareus, or Macareus, as the Scholiast of Sophocles
calls him. Neptune being the father of Onchestius, Hippomenes was the
fourth from Neptune, inclusively. Onchestius founded a city of that name
in Bœotia, in honour of Neptune, who had a temple there; in the time of
Pausanias the place was in ruins. That author tells us that Megareus
aided Nisus against Minos, and was slain in that war.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">While</span> Orpheus is singing to his lyre on
Mount Rhodope, the women of Thrace celebrate their orgies. During that
ceremony they take advantage of the opportunity to punish Orpheus for
his indifference towards their sex; and, in the fury inspired by their
rites, they beat him to death. His head and lyre are carried by the
stream of the river Hebrus into the sea, and are cast on shore on the
isle of Lesbos. A&nbsp;serpent, about to attack the head when thrown on
shore, is changed into a stone, and the Bacchanals who have killed him
are transformed into trees.</p>

<p>While with songs such as these, the Thracian poet is leading the
woods and the natures of savage beasts, and the following rocks, lo! the
matrons of the Ciconians, having their raving breasts covered with the
skins of wild beasts, from the summit of a hill, espy Orpheus adapting
his voice to the sounded strings <i>of his harp</i>. One of these,
tossing her hair along the light breeze, says, “See! see! here is our
contemner!” and hurls her spear at the melodious mouth of the bard of
Apollo: <i>but</i>, being wreathed at the end with leaves, it makes a
mark without any wound. The weapon of another is a stone, which, when
thrown, is overpowered in the very air by the harmony of his voice and
his lyre, and lies before his feet, a&nbsp;suppliant, as it were, for an
attempt so daring.</p>

<p>But still this rash warfare increases, and <i>all</i> moderation
departs, and direful fury reigns <i>triumphant</i>. And <i>yet</i> all
their weapons would have been conquered by his music; but the vast
clamour, and the Berecynthian pipe<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_1" id =
"tag11_1" href = "#note11_1">1</a> with the blown horns, and the
tambourines, and the clapping of hands, and Bacchanalian yells,
prevented the sound of the lyre from being heard.

Then, at last, the stones became red with the blood of the bard,
<i>now</i> no longer heard. But first the Mænades lay hands on
innumerable birds, even yet charmed with his voice as he sang, and
serpents, and a throng of wild beasts, the glory of <i>this</i> audience
of Orpheus; and after that, they turn upon Orpheus with blood-stained
right hands; and they flock together, as the birds, if at any time they
see the bird of night strolling about by day; <i>and</i> as when the
stag that is doomed to die<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_2" id =

amphitheatre is a prey to the dogs; they both attack the bard, and hurl
the thyrsi, covered with
<span class = "pagenum">381</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 28-60.</span>
green leaves, not made for such purposes as these. Some throw clods,
some branches torn from trees, others flint stones. And that weapons may
not be wanting for their fury, by chance some oxen are turning up the
earth with the depressed ploughshare; and not far from thence, some
strong-armed peasants, providing the harvest with plenteous sweat, are
digging the hard fields; they, seeing this <i>frantic</i> troop, run
away, and leave the implements of their labour; and there lie, dispersed
throughout the deserted fields, harrows and heavy rakes, and long
spades.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "superfluous open quote">After</ins> they, in their rage, have seized upon these, and have
torn to pieces the oxen with their threatening horns, they return to the

effect on them with his voice. And (Oh Jupiter!) through those lips

(wondrous <i>to relate</i>!) while it rolls down the midst of the
stream, the lyre complains in I know not what kind of mournful strain.
His lifeless tongue, <i>too</i>, utters a mournful sound, <i>to
which</i> the banks mournfully reply. And now, borne onward to the sea,
they leave their native stream, and reach the shores of Methymnæan

descends under the earth, and he recognizes all the spots which he has
formerly seen; and seeking Eurydice through the fields of the blessed,

Eurydice.</p>

<p>Yet Lyæus did not suffer this wickedness to go unpunished; and
grieving for the loss of the bard of his sacred rites, he immediately
fastened down in the woods, by a twisting root, all the Edonian matrons
who had committed this crime. For he drew out the toes of her feet, just
as each one had pursued him, and thrust them by their sharp points into
the solid earth. And, as when a bird has entangled its leg in a snare,
which the cunning fowler has concealed, and perceives that it is held
fast, it beats its wings, and, fluttering, tightens the noose with its
struggles; so, as each one of these had stuck fast, fixed in the ground,
in her alarm, she attempted flight in vain; but the pliant root held her
fast, and confined her, springing forward<a class = "tag" name =

while she is looking where her toes are, where, <i>too</i>, are her feet
and her nails, she sees wood growing up upon her well-turned legs.
Endeavouring, too, to smite her thigh, with grieving right hand, she
strikes solid oak; her breast, too, becomes oak; her shoulders are oak.
You would suppose that her extended arms are real boughs, and you would
not be deceived in <i>so</i> supposing.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Some of the ancient mythologists say that the story of the serpent,
changed into stone for insulting the head of Orpheus, was founded on the
history of a certain inhabitant of the isle of Lesbos, who was punished
for attacking the reputation of Orpheus. This critic excited contempt,
as a malignant and ignorant person, who endeavoured, as it were, to
sting the character of the deceased poet, and therefore, by way of
exposing his spite and stupidity, he was said to have been changed from
a serpent into a stone. According to Philostratus, the poet’s head was
preserved in the temple of Apollo at Lesbos; and he tells us that
Diomedes, and
<span class = "pagenum">383</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 85-94.</span>
Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, brought Philoctetes to Troy, after
having explained to him the oracular response which the head of Orpheus
had given to him from the bottom of a cave at Lesbos.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The harp of Orpheus was preserved in the same temple; and so many
wonders were reported of it, that Neanthus, the son of the tyrant
Pytharus, purchased it of the priests of Apollo, believing that its
sound would be sufficient to put rocks and trees in motion; but,
according to Lucian, he succeeded so ill, that on his trying the harp,
the dogs of the neighbouring villages fell upon him and tore him to
pieces.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The transformation of the women of Thrace into trees, for the murder of
Orpheus, is probably an allegory intended to show that these furious and
ill-conditioned females did not escape punishment for their misdeeds;
and that they were driven by society to pass the rest of their lives in
woods and caverns.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Bacchus</span>, having punished the Thracian
women for the murder of Orpheus, leaves Thrace. His tutor, Silenus,
having become intoxicated, loses his companions, and is brought by some
Phrygian peasants to Midas. He sends him to Bacchus, on which the God,
in acknowledgment of his kindness, promises him whatever favour he may
desire. Midas asks to be able to turn everything that he touches into
gold. This power is granted; but, soon convinced of his folly, Midas
begs the God to deprive him of it, on which he is ordered to bathe in
the river Pactolus. He obeys the God, and communicates the power which
he possesses to the stream; from which time that river has golden
sands.</p>

<p>And this is not enough for Bacchus. He resolves to forsake the
country itself, and, with a superior train, he repairs to the vineyards
of his own Tymolus, and Pactolus; although it was not golden at that
time, nor to be coveted for its precious sands. The usual throng,
<i>both</i> Satyrs and Bacchanals, surround him, but Silenus is away.
The Phrygian rustics took him, as he was staggering with age and wine,
and, bound with garlands, they led him to <i>their</i> king, Midas, to
whom, together with the Cecropian Eumolpus,<a class = "tag" name =

had intrusted the <i>mysterious</i> orgies <i>of Bacchus</i>. Soon as he
recognized this associate
<span class = "pagenum">384</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 94-130.</span>
and companion of these rites, he hospitably kept a festival on the
coming of this guest, for twice five days, and <i>as many</i> nights
joined in succession.</p>

<p>“And now the eleventh Lucifer had closed the lofty host of the stars,
when the king came rejoicing to the Lydian lands, and restored Silenus
to the youth, his foster-child. To him the God, being glad at the
recovery of his foster-father, gave the choice of desiring a favour,
pleasing, <i>indeed</i>, but useless, <i>as it turned out</i>. He,
destined to make a foolish use of the favour, says, ‘Cause that whatever
I shall touch with my body shall be turned into yellow gold.’ Liber
assents to his wish, and grants him the hurtful favour, and is grieved
that he has not asked for something better. The Berecynthian hero<a
class = "tag" name = "tag11_9" id = "tag11_9" href = "#note11_9">9</a>
departs joyful, and rejoices in his own misfortune, and tries the truth
of his promise by touching everything. And, hardly believing himself, he
pulls down a twig from a holm-oak, growing on a bough not lofty; the
twig becomes gold. He takes up a stone from the ground; the stone, too,
turns pale with gold. He touches a clod, also; by his potent touch the
clod becomes a mass <i>of gold</i>. He plucks some dry ears of corn,
that wheat is golden. He holds an apple taken from a tree, you would
suppose that the Hesperides had given it. If he places his fingers upon
the lofty door-posts, <i>then</i> the posts are seen to glisten. When,
too, he has washed his hands in the liquid stream, the water flowing
from his hands might have deceived Danaë. He scarcely can contain his
own hopes in his mind, imagining everything to be of gold. As he is
<i>thus</i> rejoicing, his servants set before him a table supplied with
dainties, and not deficient in parched corn. But then, whether he
touches the gifts of Ceres with his right hand, the gifts of Ceres,
<i>as gold</i>, become hard; or if he attempts to bite the dainties with
hungry teeth, those dainties, upon the application of his teeth, shine
as yellow plates of gold. <i>Bacchus</i>, the grantor of this favour, he
mingles with pure water; you could see liquid gold flowing through his

by the <i>now</i> hated gold; and raising his hands towards heaven, and

done wrong, but have pity on me, I&nbsp;pray, and deliver me from this
specious calamity!” Bacchus, the gentle Divinity among the Gods,
restored him, as he confessed that he had done wrong, <i>to his former
state</i>, and annulled his given promise, and the favour that was
granted: “And that thou mayst not remain overlaid with thy gold, so
unhappily desired, go,” said he, “to the river adjoining to great
Sardis,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_10" id = "tag11_10" href =

from the height of the mountain, until thou comest to the rise of the
stream. And plunge thy head beneath the bubbling spring, where it bursts
forth most abundantly, and at once purge thy body, at once thy crime.”
The king placed himself beneath the waters prescribed; the golden virtue
tinged the river, and departed from the human body into the stream. And
even now, the fields, receiving the ore of this ancient vein <i>of
gold</i>, are hard, growing of pallid colour, from their clods imbibing
the gold.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The ancients divided the Divinities into several classes, and in the
last class, which Ovid calls the populace, or commonalty of the Gods,
were the Satyrs and Sileni. The latter, according to Pausanias, were no
other than Satyrs of advanced age. There seems, however, to have been
one among them, to whom the name of Silenus was especially given, and to
him the present story relates. According to Pindar and Pausanias he was
born at Malea, in Laconia; while Theopompus, quoted by Ælian, represents
him as being the son of a Nymph. He was inferior to the higher
Divinities, but superior to man, in not being subject to mortality. He
was represented as bald, flat-nosed, and red-faced, a&nbsp;perfect
specimen of a drunken old man. He is often introduced either sitting on
an ass, or reeling along on foot, with a thyrsus to support him.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
He was said to have tended the education of the infant Bacchus, and
indeed, according to the author whose works are quoted as those of
Orpheus, he was an especial favourite of the Gods; while some writers
represent him not as a drunken old man, but as a learned philosopher and
a skilful commander. Lucian combines the two characters, and describes
him as an aged man with large straight ears and a huge belly, wearing
yellow clothes, and generally mounted on an ass, or supported by a
staff, but, nevertheless, as being a skilful general. Hyginus says, that
the Phrygian peasants found Midas near a fountain, into which,
<span class = "pagenum">386</span>
according to Xenophon, some one had put wine, which had made him drunk.
In his interview with Midas, according to Theopompus, as quoted by
Ælian, they had a conversation concerning that unknown region of the
earth, to which Plato refers under the name of the New Atlantis, and
which, after long employing the speculations of the ancient
philosophers, was realized to the moderns in the discovery of America.
The passage is sufficiently curious to deserve to be quoted. He says,
“Asia, Europe, and Libya, are but three islands, surrounded by the
ocean; but beyond that ocean there is a vast continent, whose bounds are
entirely unknown to us. The men and the animals of that country are much
larger, and live much longer than those of this part of the world. Their
towns are fine and magnificent; their customs are different from ours;
and they are governed by different laws. They have two cities, one of
which is called ‘the Warlike,’ and the other ‘the Devout.’ The
inhabitants of the first city are much given to warfare, and make
continual attacks upon their neighbours, whom they bring under their
subjection. Those who inhabit the other city are peaceable, and blessed
with plenty; the earth without toil or tillage furnishing them with
abundance of the necessaries of life. Except their sick, they all live
in the midst of riches and continual festivity and pleasure; but they
are so just and righteous that the Gods themselves delight to go
frequently and pass their time among them.</p>

<p>“The warlike people of the first city having extended their conquests
in their own vast continent, made an irruption into ours, with a million
of men, as far as the country of the Hyperboreans; but when they saw
their mode of living, they deemed them to be unworthy of their notice,
and returned home. These warriors rarely die of sickness; they delight
in warfare, and generally lose their lives in battle. There is also in
this new world another numerous people called Meropes; and in their
country is a place called ‘Anostus,’ that is to say, ‘not to be
repassed,’ because no one ever comes back from thence. It is a dreadful
abyss, having no other than a reddish sort of light. There are two
rivers in that place; one called the River of Sorrow, and the other the
River of Mirth. Trees as large as planes grow about these rivers. Those
who eat of the fruit of the trees growing near the River of Sorrow, pass
their lives in affliction, weeping continually, even to their last
breath; but such as eat of the fruit of the other trees, forget the
past, and revert through the different stages of their life, and then
die.”</p>

<p>Ælian regards the passage as a mere fable, and the latter part is
clearly allegorical. The mention of the two cities, ‘the Warlike’ and
‘the Devout,’ can hardly fail to remind us of Japan, with its spiritual
and temporal capitals.</p>

<p>Some writers say, that Silenus was the king of Caria, and was the
contemporary and friend of Midas, to whom his counsel proved of
considerable service, in governing his dominions. He was probably called
the foster-father or tutor, of Bacchus, because he introduced his
worship into Phrygia and the neighbouring countries.</p>

company approve of his judgment except Midas, who, for his stupidity in
preferring Pan, receives a pair of asses’ ears. He carefully conceals
them till they are discovered by his barber, who publishes his deformity
in a very singular manner.</p>

<p>He, abhorring riches, inhabited the woods and the fields, and

erect, steep with its lofty ascent; and extending in its descent on
either side, is bounded on the one side by Sardis, on the other by the
little Hypæpæ.</p>

<p>While Pan is there boasting of his strains to the charming Nymphs,
and is warbling a little tune upon the reeds joined with wax, daring to
despise the playing of Apollo in comparison with his own, he comes to
the unequal contest under the arbitration of Tmolus.<a class = "tag"

He sounds his rustic reeds, and delights Midas with his uncouth music;
for he, by chance, is present as he plays. After this the sacred Tmolus
turns his face towards the countenance of Apollo; his words follow

<span class = "pagenum">388</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 169-193.</span>
is that of an artist. He then touches the strings with a skilful thumb;
charmed by the sweetness of which, Tmolus bids Pan to hold his reeds in
submission to the lyre; and the judgment and decision of the sacred
mountain pleases them all. Yet it is blamed, and is called unjust by the
voice of Midas alone. But the Delian <i>God</i> does not allow his
stupid ears to retain their human shape: but draws them out to a
<i>great</i> length, and he fills them with grey hairs, and makes them
unsteady at the lower part, and gives them the power of moving. The rest
<i>of his body</i> is that of a man; in one part alone is he condemned
<i>to punishment</i>; and he assumes the ears of the slowly moving
ass.</p>

<p>He, indeed, concealed them, and endeavoured to veil his temples,
laden with this foul disgrace, with a purple turban. But a servant, who
was wont to cut his hair, when long, with the steel <ins class =

who, when he did not dare disclose the disgraceful thing he had seen,

of ears he had beheld on his master, and whispered it to the earth cast
up. And <i>then</i> he buried this discovery of his voice with the earth
thrown in again, and, having covered up the ditch, departed in
silence.</p>

<p>There, a grove, thick set with quivering reeds, began to rise; and as

Midas, according to Pausanias, was the son of Gordius and Cybele, and
reigned in the Greater Phrygia. Strabo says that he and his father kept
their court near the river Sangar, in cities which, in the time of that
author had become mean villages. As Midas was very rich, and at the same
time very frugal, it was reported that whatever he touched was at once
turned into gold; and Bacchus was probably introduced into his story,
because Midas had favoured the introduction of his worship, and was
consequently supposed to have owed his success to the good offices of
that Divinity. He was probably the first who extracted gold from the
sands of the river Pactolus, and in that circumstance the story may have
originated. Strabo says that Midas found the treasures which he
possessed in the mines of Mount Bermius. It was said that in his infancy
some ants were seen to creep into his cradle, and to put grains of wheat
in his mouth, which was supposed to portend that he would be rich and
frugal.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">389</span>

<p class = "explanation">
As he was very stupid and ignorant, the fable of his preference of the
music of Pan to that of Apollo was invented, to which was added,
perhaps, as a mark of his stupidity, that the God gave him a pair of
asses’ ears. The scholiast of Aristophanes, to explain the story, says
either it was intended to shew that Midas, like the ass, was very quick
of hearing, or in other words, had numerous spies in all parts of his
dominions; or, it was invented, because his usual place of residence was
called Onouta, <span class = "greek" title = "onou ôta">ὄνου ὦτα</span>,
‘the ears of an ass.’ Strabo says that he took a draught of warm
bullock’s blood, from the effects of which he died; and, according to
Plutarch, he did so to deliver himself from the frightful dreams with
which he was tormented.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Tmolus, the king of Lydia, according to Clitophon, was the son of Mars
and the Nymph Theogene, or, according to Eustathius, of Sipylus and
Eptonia. Having violated Arriphe, a&nbsp;Nymph of Diana, he was, as a
punishment, tossed by a bull, and falling on some sharp pointed stakes,
he lost his life, and was buried on the mountain that afterwards bore
his name.</p>

Laomedon defrauds him likewise of the horses which he has promised him.
In revenge, Hercules plunders the city of Troy, and carries off Hesione,

<p>The work is <i>now</i> finished; the king refuses the reward, and, as

all his waters towards the shores of covetous Troy. He turns the land,
too, into the form of the sea, and carries off the wealth of the
husbandmen, and overwhelms the fields with waves. Nor is this punishment
sufficient: the daughter of the king, is also demanded for a sea
monster. Chained to the rugged rocks, Alcides delivers her, and demands
the promised reward, the horses agreed upon; and the recompense of so
great a service being denied him, he captures the twice-perjured walls
of conquered Troy. Nor does Telamon, a&nbsp;sharer in the warfare, come

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Laomedon, being King of Troy, and the city being open and defenceless,
he undertook to enclose it with walls, and succeeded so well, that the
work was attributed to Apollo. The strong banks which he was obliged to
raise to keep out the sea and to prevent inundations, were regarded as
the work of Neptune. In time, these banks being broken down by tempests,
it was reported that the God of the sea had thus revenged himself on
Laomedon, for refusing him the reward which had been agreed upon between
them. This story received the more ready credit from the circumstance
mentioned by Herodotus and Eustathius, that this king used the treasure
belonging to the temple of Neptune, in raising these embankments, and
building the walls of his city; having promised the priests to restore
it when he should be in a condition to do so; which promise he never
performed. Homer says that Neptune and Apollo tended the flocks while
all the subjects of Laomedon were engaged in building the walls.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
When these embankments were laid under water, and a plague began to rage
within the city, the Trojans were told by an oracle that to appease the
God of the sea, they must sacrifice a virgin of the royal blood. The lot
fell upon Hesione, and she was exposed to the fury of a sea-monster.
Hercules offered to deliver her for a reward of six horses,
<span class = "pagenum">391</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 211-228.</span>
and having succeeded, was refused his recompense by Laomedon; whom he
slew, and then plundered his city. He then gave the kingdom to Podarces,
the son of Laomedon, and Hesione to his companion Telamon, who had
assisted him. This monster was probably an allegorical representation of
the inundations of the sea; and Hesione having been made the price of
him that could succeed in devising a remedy, she was said to have been
exposed to the fury of a monster. The six horses promised by Laomedon
were perhaps so many ships, which Hercules demanded for his recompense;
and this is the more likely, as the ancients said that these horses were
so light and swift, that they ran upon the waves, which story seems to
point at the qualities of a galley or ship under sail.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Lycophron gives a more wonderful version of the story. He says that the
monster, to which Hesione was exposed, devoured Hercules, and that he
was three days in its belly, and came out, having lost all his hair.
This is, probably, a&nbsp;way of telling us that Hercules and his
assistants were obliged to work in the water, which incommoded them very
much. Palæphatus gives another explanation: he says that Hesione was
about to be delivered up to a pirate, and that Hercules, on boarding his
ship, was wounded, although afterwards victorious.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Proteus</span> foretells that Thetis shall
have a son, who shall be more powerful than his father, and shall exceed
him in valour. Jupiter, who is in love with Thetis, is alarmed at this
prediction, and yields her to Peleus. The Goddess flies from his
advances by assuming various shapes, till, by the advice of Proteus, he
holds her fast, and then having married her, she bears Achilles. Peleus
goes afterwards to Ceyx, king of Trachyn, to expiate the death of his
brother Phocus, whom he has killed. Ceyx is in a profound melancholy,
and tells him how his brother Dædalion, in the transports of his grief
for his daughter Chione, who had been slain for vying with Diana, has
been transformed into a hawk. During this relation, Peleus is informed
that a wolf which Psamathe has sent to revenge the death of Phocus, is
destroying his herds. He endeavours to avert the wrath of the Goddess,
but she is deaf to his entreaties, till, by the intercession of Thetis,
she is appeased, and she turns the wolf into stone.</p>

<p>For the aged Proteus had said to Thetis, “Goddess of the waves,
conceive; thou shalt be the mother of a youth, who by his gallant
actions shall surpass the deeds of his father, and shall be called
greater than he.” Therefore, lest the world might contain something
greater than Jove, although he had felt no gentle flame in his breast,
Jupiter avoided the embraces of Thetis,<a class = "tag" name =

covering the surface of the sand. It has a firm shore, which retains not
the impression of the foot, nor delays the step <i>of the traveller</i>,
nor is covered with sea-weeds. There is a grove of myrtle at hand,
planted with particoloured berries. In the middle there is a cave,
whether formed by nature or art, it is doubtful; still, by art rather.
To this, Thetis, thou wast wont often to come naked, seated on thy
harnessed dolphin. There Peleus seized upon thee, as thou wast lying
fast bound in sleep; and because, being tried by entreaties, thou didst
resist, he resolved upon violence, clasping thy neck with both his arms.
And, unless thou hadst had recourse to thy wonted arts, by frequently
changing thy shape, he would have succeeded in his attempt. But, at one
moment, thou wast a bird (still, as a bird he held thee fast); at
another time a large tree: to <i>that</i> tree did Peleus cling. Thy
third form was that of a spotted tiger; frightened by that, the son of
Æacus loosened his arms from thy body.</p>

“Son of Æacus, thou shalt gain the alliance desired by thee. Do thou
only, when she shall be resting fast asleep in the cool cave, bind her
unawares with cords and tenacious bonds. And let her not deceive thee,
by imitating a hundred forms; but hold her fast, whatever she shall be,
until she shall reassume the form which she had before.” Proteus said
this, and hid his face in the sea, and received his own waves at his
closing words. Titan was <i>now</i> descending, and, with the pole of
his chariot bent downward, was taking possession of the Hesperian main;
when the beautiful

Nereid, leaving the deep, entered her wonted place of repose. Hardly had
Peleus well seized the virgin’s limbs, <i>when</i> she changed her
shape, until she perceived her limbs to be held fast, and her arms to be
extended different ways. Then, at last, she sighed, and said, “Not
without <i>the aid of</i> a Divinity, dost thou overcome me;” and then
she appeared <i>as</i> Thetis <i>again</i>. The hero embraced her

great Achilles.</p>

his sire in his face, held the sway without violence and without
bloodshed, who, being sad at that time and unlike his <i>former</i>
self, lamented the loss of his brother. After the son of Æacus, wearied,
both with troubles and the length of the journey, has arrived there, and
has entered the city with a few attending him, and has left the flocks

id = "tag11_26" href = "#note11_26">26</a> to make white out of black,

Is even glory <i>thus</i> prejudicial to many? To her, at least, it was
a prejudice; who dared to prefer herself to Diana, and decried the
charms of the Goddess. But violent wrath was excited in her, and she
said, ‘We will please her by our deeds.’<a class = "tag" name =
"tag11_28" id = "tag11_28" href = "#note11_28">28</a> And there was no
delay: she bent her bow, and let fly an arrow from the string, and
pierced with the reed the tongue that deserved it. The tongue was
silent; nor did her voice, and the words which she attempted <i>to
utter, now</i> follow; and life, with her blood, left her, as she
endeavoured to speak. Oh hapless affection! What pain did I <i>then</i>
endure in my heart, as her uncle, and what consolations did I give to my
affectionate brother? These the father received no otherwise than rocks
do the murmurs of the ocean, and he bitterly lamented his daughter
<i>thus</i> snatched from him. But when he beheld her burning, four
times had he an impulse to rush into the midst of the pile; thence
repulsed, four times did he commit his swift limbs to flight, and, like
an ox, bearing upon his galled neck the stings of hornets, he rushed
where there was no path. Already did he seem to me to run faster than a
human being, and you would have supposed that his feet had assumed
wings. Therefore he outran all; and, made swift by the desire for death,
he gained the heights of Parnassus.</p>

<p>“Apollo pitying him, when Dædalion would have thrown himself from the
top of the rock, made him into a bird, and supported him, hovering <i>in
the air</i> upon <i>these</i> sudden wings; and he gave him a curved
beak, and crooked claws on his talons, his former courage, and strength
greater <i>in proportion</i> than his body; and, now <i>become</i> a
hawk, sufficiently benignant to none, he rages <i>equally</i> against
all birds; and grieving <i>himself</i>, becomes the cause of grief to
others.”</p>

<p>While the son of Lucifer is relating these wonders about his brother,
hastening with panting speed, Phocæan Antenor, the keeper of his herds,
runs up to him. “Alas, Peleus! Peleus!” says he, “I&nbsp;am the
messenger to thee of a great calamity;” and <i>then</i> Peleus bids him
declare whatever news it is that he has brought; and the Trachinian hero
himself is in suspense, and trembles through apprehension. The other
tells <i>his story:</i> “I&nbsp;had driven the weary bullocks to the
winding shore, when
<span class = "pagenum">396</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 353-388.</span>
the Sun at his height, in the midst of his course, could look back on as
much of it as he could see to be <i>now</i> remaining; and a part of the
oxen had bent their knees on the yellow sands, and, as they lay, viewed
the expanse of the wide waters; some, with slow steps, were wandering
here and there; others were swimming, and appearing with their lofty
necks above the waves. A&nbsp;temple is hard by the sea, adorned neither
with marble nor with gold, but <i>made</i> of solid beams, and shaded
with an ancient grove; the Nereids and Nereus possess it. A&nbsp;sailor,
while he was drying his nets upon the shore, told us that these were the
Gods of the temple. Adjacent to this is a marsh, planted thickly with
numerous willows, which the water of the stagnating waves of the sea has
made into a swamp. From that spot, a&nbsp;huge monster, a&nbsp;wolf,
roaring with a loud bellowing, alarms the neighbouring places, and comes
forth from the thicket of the marsh, <i>both</i> having his thundering
jaws covered with foam and with clotted blood, <i>and</i> his eyes
suffused with red flame. Though he was raging both with fury and with
hunger, still was he more excited by fury; for he did not care to
satisfy his hunger by the slaughter of the oxen, and to satiate his
dreadful appetite, but he mangled the whole herd, and, like a true foe,
pulled each <i>to the ground</i>. Some, too, of ourselves, while we were
defending them, wounded with his fatal bite, were killed. The shore and
the nearest waves were red with blood, and the fens were filled with the
lowings <i>of the herd</i>. But delay is dangerous, and the case does
not allow us to hesitate: while anything is <i>still</i> left, let us
all unite, and let us take up arms, arms, <i>I&nbsp;say</i>, and in a
body let us bear weapons.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> speaks the countryman. And the loss does not affect
Peleus; but, remembering his crime, he considers that the bereaved
Nereid has sent these misfortunes of his, as an offering to the departed
Phocus. The Œtæan king<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_29" id = "tag11_29"
href = "#note11_29">29</a> commands his men to put on their armour, and
to take up stout weapons; together with whom, he himself is preparing to
go. But Halcyone, his wife, alarmed at the tumult, runs out, and not yet
having arranged all her hair, even that which is <i>arranged</i> she
throws in disorder; and clinging to the neck of her husband, she
entreats him, both with words and tears, to send assistance without
himself, and <i>so</i> to save two lives in one.
<span class = "pagenum">397</span>

The son of Æacus says to her, “O&nbsp;queen, lay aside thy commendable
and affectionate fears; the kindness of thy proposal is <i>too</i> great
<i>for me</i>. It does not please me, that arms should be employed
against this new monster. The Divinity of the sea must be adored.” There
is a lofty tower; a&nbsp;fire <i>is</i> upon the extreme summit,<a class
= "tag" name = "tag11_30" id = "tag11_30" href = "#note11_30">30</a>
a&nbsp;place grateful to wearied ships. They go up there, and with sighs
they behold the bulls lying scattered upon the sea shore, and the cruel
ravager with blood-stained mouth, having his long hair stained with
gore. Peleus, thence extending his hands towards the open sea, entreats
the azure Psamathe to lay aside her wrath, and to give him her aid. But
she is not moved by the words of the son of Æacus, thus entreating.
Thetis, interceding on behalf of her husband, obtains that favour <i>for
him</i>.</p>

<p>But still the wolf persists, not recalled from the furious slaughter,
<i>and</i> keenly urged by the sweetness of the blood; until she changes
him into marble, as he is fastening on the neck of a mangled heifer. His
body preserves every thing except its colour. The colour of the stone
shows that he is not now a wolf, and ought not now to be feared. Still,
the Fates do not permit the banished Peleus to settle in this land: the
wandering exile goes to the Magnetes,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_31"

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Thetis being a woman of extraordinary beauty, it is not improbable, that
in the Epithalamia that were composed on her marriage, it was asserted,
that the Gods had contended for her hand, and had been forced to give
way, in obedience to the superior power of destiny. Hyginus says that
Prometheus was the only person that was acquainted with the oracle; and
that he imparted it to Jupiter, on condition that he would deliver him
from the eagle that tormented him: whereupon the God sent Hercules to
Mount Caucasus, to perform his promise. It was on the occasion of this
marriage that the Goddess Discord presented the golden apple, the
dispute for which occasioned the Trojan war. The part of the story which
relates how she assumed various forms, to avoid the advances of Peleus,
is perhaps an ingenious method of stating, that having several suitors,
she was originally disinclined to Peleus, and used every pretext to
avoid him, until, by the advice of a wise friend, he found means to
remove all the difficulties which opposed his alliance with her.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Some writers state that Thetis was the daughter of Chiron; but
Euripides, in a fragment of his Iphigenia, tells us that Achilles, who
was the son of this marriage, took a pride in carrying the figure of a
Nereid on his shield. The three sons of Æacus were Peleus, Telamon, and
Phocus; while they were playing at quoits, the latter accidentally
received a blow from Peleus, which killed him. Ovid, however, seems here
to imply that Peleus killed his brother purposely.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Chione most probably took its rise from the difference
between the inclinations of the two children that she bore. Autolycus,
being cunning, and addicted to theft, he was styled the son of Mercury;
while Philammon being a lover of music, Apollo was said to be his
father. According to Pausanias, Autolycus was the son of Dædalion, and
not of Chione. The story of the wolf, the minister of the vengeance of
Psamathe, for the death of Phocus, is probably built on historical
grounds. Æacus had two wives, Ægina and Psamathe, the sister of Thetis;
by the first he had Peleus and Telamon; by the second, Phocus.
Lycomedes, the king of Scyros, the brother of Psamathe, resolved to
revenge the death of his nephew, whom Peleus had killed: and declared
war against Ceyx, for receiving him into his dominions. The troops of
Lycomedes ravaged the country, and carried away the flocks of Peleus: on
which prayers and entreaties were resorted to, with the view of
pacifying him; which object having been effected, he withdrew his
troops. On this, it was rumoured that he was changed into a rock, after
having ravaged the country like a wild beast, which comparison was
perhaps suggested by the fact of his name being partly compounded of the
word <span class = "greek" title = "lukos">λυκὸς</span>, ‘a wolf.’</p>

<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">Ceyx</span>, going to Claros, to consult the
oracle about his brother’s fate, is shipwrecked on the voyage. Juno
sends Iris to the God of Sleep, who, at her request, dispatches Morpheus
to Halcyone, in a dream, to inform her of the death of her husband. She
awakes in the morning, full of solicitude, and goes to the shore where
she finds the body of Ceyx thrown up by the waves. She is about to cast
herself into the sea in despair, when the Gods transform them both into
king-fishers.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Ceyx being disturbed in mind, both on account of
the strange fate of his brother, and <i>the wonders</i> that had
succeeded his brother, prepares to go to the Clarian God, that he may
consult the sacred oracle, the consolation of mortals: for the profane
Phorbas,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_33" id = "tag11_33" href =
"#note11_33">33</a> with his Phlegyans, renders the <i>oracle</i> of
Delphi inaccessible. Yet he first makes thee acquainted with his design,
most faithful Halcyone, whose bones receive a chill, and a paleness,
much resembling boxwood, comes over her face, and her cheeks are wet
with tears gushing forth. Three times attempting to speak, three times
she moistens her face with tears, and, sobs interrupting her
affectionate complaints, she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What fault of mine, my dearest, has changed thy mind? Where is that
care of me, which once used to exist? Canst thou now be absent without
anxiety, thy Halcyone being left behind? Now, is a long journey pleasing
to thee? Now, am I dearer to thee when at a distance? But I suppose thy
journey is by land, and I shall only grieve, and shall not fear as well,
and my anxiety will be free from apprehension. The seas and the aspect
of the stormy ocean affright me. And lately I beheld broken planks on
the sea shore; and often have I read the names upon tombs,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag11_34" id = "tag11_34" href = "#note11_34">34</a>
without bodies <i>there buried</i>.
<span class = "pagenum">400</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 430-460.</span>
And let not any deceitful assurance influence thy mind, that the
grandson of Hippotas<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_35" id = "tag11_35"
href = "#note11_35">35</a> is thy father-in-law; who confines the strong
winds in prison, and assuages the seas when he pleases. When, once let
loose, the winds have taken possession of the deep, nothing is forbidden
to them; every land and every sea is disregarded by them. Even the
clouds of heaven do they insult, and by their bold onsets strike forth
the brilliant fires.<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_36" id = "tag11_36"
href = "#note11_36">36</a> The more I know them, (for I do know them,
and, when little, have often seen them in my father’s abode,) the more I
think they are to be dreaded. But if thy resolution, my dear husband,
cannot be altered by my entreaties, and if thou art <i>but</i> too
determined to go; take me, too, as well. At least, we shall be tossed
together; nor shall I fear anything, but what I shall be <i>then</i>
suffering; and together we shall endure whatever shall happen; together
we shall be carried over the wide seas.”</p>

<p>By such words and the tears of the daughter of Æolus, is her husband,
son of the <i>Morning</i> Star, <i>much</i> affected; for the flame
<i>of love</i> exists no less in him. But he neither wishes to abandon
his proposed voyage, nor to admit Halcyone to a share in the danger; and
he says, in answer, many things to console her timorous breast. And yet
she does not, on that account, approve of his reasons. To them he adds
this alleviation, with which alone he influences his affectionate
<i>wife</i>: “All delay will, indeed, be tedious to me; but I swear to
thee by the fire of my sire, (if only the fates allow me to return,)
that I will come back before the moon has twice completed her orb.”
When, by these promises, a&nbsp;hope has been given her of his
<i>speedy</i> return, he forthwith orders a ship, drawn out of the dock,
to be launched in the sea, and to be supplied with its <i>proper</i>
equipments. On seeing this, Halcyone again shuddered, as though
presaging the future, and shed her flowing tears, and gave him embraces;
and at last, in extreme misery, she said, with a sad voice, “Farewell!”
and then she sank with all her body <i>to the ground</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">401</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 461-479.</span>

<p>But the youths, while Ceyx is <i>still</i> seeking pretexts for
delay, in double rows,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_37" id = "tag11_37"
href = "#note11_37">37</a> draw the oars towards their hardy breasts,
and cleave the main with equal strokes. She raises her weeping eyes, and
sees her husband standing on the crooked stern, and by waving his hand
making the first signs to her; and she returns the signals. When the
land has receded further, and her eyes are unable to distinguish his
countenance: <i>still</i>, while she can, she follows the retreating
ship with her sight. When this too, borne onward, cannot be
distinguished from the distance; still she looks at the sails waving
from the top of the mast. When she no <i>longer</i> sees the sails; she
anxiously seeks her deserted bed, and lays herself on the couch. The
bed, and the spot, renew the tears of Halcyone, and remind her what part
<i>of herself</i> is wanting.</p>

<p>They have <i>now</i> gone out of harbour, and the breeze shakes the
rigging; the sailor urges the pendent oars towards their sides;<a class
= "tag" name = "tag11_38" id = "tag11_38" href = "#note11_38">38</a> and
fixes the sailyards<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_39" id = "tag11_39"
href = "#note11_39">39</a> on the top of the mast, and spreads the
canvass full from the mast, and catches the coming breezes. Either the
smaller part, or, at least, not more than half her course, had
<i>now</i> been cut by the ship, and both lands were at a
<span class = "pagenum">402</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 479-515.</span>
great distance, when, towards night, the sea began to grow white with
swelling waves, and the boisterous East wind to blow with greater
violence. Presently the master cries, “At once, lower the top sails, and
furl the whole of the sail to the yards!” He orders, <i>but</i> the
adverse storm impedes the execution; and the roaring of the sea does not
allow any voice to be heard.</p>

<p>Yet, of their own accord, some hasten to draw in the oars, some to
secure the sides, some to withdraw the sails from the winds. This one
pumps up the waves, and pours back the sea into the sea; another takes
off the yards. While these things are being done without any order, the
raging storm is increasing, and the fierce winds wage war on every side,
and stir up the furious main. The master of the ship is himself alarmed,
and himself confesses that he does not know what is their <i>present</i>
condition, nor what to order or forbid; so great is the amount of their
misfortunes, and more powerful than all his skill. For the men are
making a noise with their shouts, the cordage with its rattling, the
heavy waves with the dashing of <i>other</i> waves, the skies with the
thunder. The sea is upturned with billows, and appears to reach the
heavens, and to sprinkle the surrounding clouds with its foam. And one
while, when it turns up the yellow sands from the bottom, it is of the
same colour with them; at another time <i>it is</i> blacker than the
Stygian waves. Sometimes it is level, and is white with resounding foam.
The Trachinian ship too, is influenced by these vicissitudes; and now
aloft, as though from the summit of a mountain, it seems to look down
upon the vallies and the depths of Acheron; at another moment, when the
engulphing sea has surrounded it, sunk below, it seems to be looking at
heaven above from the infernal waters. Struck on its side by the waves,
it often sends forth a low crashing sound, and beaten against, it sounds
with no less noise, than on an occasion when the iron battering ram, or
the balista, is shaking the shattered towers. And as fierce lions are
wont, gaining strength in their career, to rush with their breasts upon
the weapons, and arms extended <i>against them</i>; so the water, when
upon the rising of the winds it had rushed onwards, advanced against the
rigging of the ship, and was much higher than&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>And now the bolts shrink, and despoiled of their covering of wax,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag11_40" id = "tag11_40" href =
"#note11_40">40</a> the seams open wide, and afford a passage to the
<span class = "pagenum">403</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 515-540.</span>
fatal waves. Behold! vast showers fall from the dissolving clouds, and
you would believe that the whole of the heavens is descending into the
deep, and that the swelling sea is ascending to the tracts of heaven.
The sails are wet with the rain, and the waves of the ocean are mingled
with the waters of the skies. The firmament is without its fires;
<i>and</i> the gloomy night is oppressed both with its own darkness and
that of the storm. Yet the lightnings disperse these, and give light as
they flash; the waters are on fire with the flames of the thunder-bolts.
And now, too, the waves make an inroad into the hollow texture of the
ship; and as a soldier, superior to all the rest of the number, after he
has often sprung forward against the fortifications of a defended city,
at length gains his desires; and, inflamed with the desire of glory,
<i>though but</i> one among a thousand more, he still mounts the wall,
so, when the violent waves have beaten against the lofty sides, the fury
of the tenth wave,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_41" id = "tag11_41"
href = "#note11_41">41</a> rising more impetuously <i>than the rest</i>,
rushes onward; and it ceases not to attack the wearied ship, before it
descends within the walls, as it were, of the captured bark. Part, then,
of the sea is still attempting to get into the ship, part is within it.
All are now in alarm, with no less intensity than a city is wont to be
alarmed, while some are undermining the walls without, and others within
have possession of the walls. <i>All</i> art fails them, and their
courage sinks; and as many <i>shapes of</i> death seem to rush and to
break in <i>upon them</i>, as the waves that approach. One does not
refrain from tears; another is stupefied; another calls those happy<a

"#note11_42">42</a> whom funeral rites

<span class = "linenum">xi. 540-569.</span>
await; another, in his prayers, addresses the Gods, and lifting up his
hands in vain to that heaven which he sees not, implores their aid. His
brothers and his parent recur to the mind of another; to another, his
home, with his pledges <i>of affection</i>, and <i>so</i> what has been
left behind by each.</p>

<p><i>The remembrance of</i> Halcyone affects Ceyx; on the lips of Ceyx
there is nothing but Halcyone; and though her alone he regrets, still he
rejoices that she is absent. <i>Gladly</i>, too, would he look back to
the shore of his native land, and turn his last glance towards his home;
but he knows not where it is. The sea is raging in a hurricane<a class =
"tag" name = "tag11_43" id = "tag11_43" href = "#note11_43">43</a> so
vast, and all the sky is concealed beneath the shade brought on by the
clouds of pitchy darkness, and the face of the night is redoubled <i>in
gloom</i>. The mast is broken by the violence of the drenching tempest;
the helm, too, is broken; and the undaunted wave, standing over its
spoil, looks down like a conqueror, upon the waves as they encircle
<i>below</i>. Nor, when precipitated, does it rush down less violently,
than if any <i>God</i> were to hurl Athos or Pindus, torn up from its
foundations, into the open sea; and with its weight and its violence
together, it sinks the ship to the bottom. With her, a&nbsp;great part
of the crew overwhelmed in the deep water, and not rising again to the
air, meet their fate. Some seize hold of portions and broken pieces of
the ship. Ceyx himself seizes a fragment of the wreck, with that hand
with which he was wont <i>to wield</i> the sceptre, and in vain, alas!
he invokes his father, and his father-in-law. But chiefly on his lips,
as he swims, is his wife Halcyone. Her he thinks of, and <i>her name</i>
he repeats: he prays the waves to impel his body before her eyes; and
that when dead he may be entombed by the hands of his friends. While he
<i>still</i> swims, he calls upon Halcyone far away, as often as the
billows allow<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_44" id = "tag11_44" href =
"#note11_44">44</a> him to open his mouth, and in the very waves he
murmurs <i>her name</i>. <i>When</i>, lo! a&nbsp;darkening arch<a class

prays that her husband may be safe, and that he may return, and may
prefer no woman before her. But this <i>last</i> alone can be her lot,
out of so many of her wishes. But the Goddess endures not any longer to

murmuring noise amid the sounding pebbles, invites sleep. Before the
doors of the cavern, poppies bloom in abundance, and innumerable herbs,
from the juice of which the humid night gathers sleep, and spreads it
over the darkened Earth. There is no door in the whole dwelling, to make
a noise by the turning of the hinges; no porter at the entrance. But in
the middle is a couch, raised high upon black ebony, stuffed with
feathers, of a dark colour, concealed by a dark coverlet; on which the
God himself lies, his limbs dissolved in sloth. Around him lie, in every
direction, imitating divers shapes, unsubstantial dreams as many as the
harvest bears ears of corn, the wood green leaves, the shore the sands
thrown up. Into this, soon as the maiden had entered, and had put aside
with her hands the visions that were

in her way, the sacred house shone with the splendour of her garment,
and the God, with difficulty lifting up his eyes sunk in languid sloth,
again and again relapsing, and striking the upper part of his breast
with his nodding chin, at last aroused himself from his <i>dozing</i>;
and, raised on his elbow, he inquired why she had come; for he knew
<i>who she was</i>.</p>

<p>But she <i>replied</i>, “Sleep, thou repose of all things; Sleep,
thou gentlest of the Deities; thou peace of the mind, from which care
flies, who dost soothe the hearts <i>of men</i>, wearied with the toils
of the day, and refittest them for labour, command a vision, that
resembles in similitude the real shape, to go to Halcyone, in Herculean
Trachyn, in the form of the king, and to assume the form of one that has
suffered shipwreck. Juno commands this.” After Iris had executed her
commission, she departed; for she could no longer endure the effects of
the vapour; and, as soon as she perceived sleep creeping over her limbs,
she took to flight,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_52" id = "tag11_52"
href = "#note11_52">52</a> and departed along the bow by which she had
come just before.</p>

<p>But Father <i>Sleep</i>, out of the multitude of his thousand sons,
raises Morpheus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_53" id = "tag11_53" href
= "#note11_53">53</a> a&nbsp;<i>skilful</i> artist, and an imitator of
<i>any human</i> shape. No one more dexterously than he mimics the gait,
and the countenance, and the mode of speaking; he adds the dress, too,
and the words most commonly used by any one. But he imitates men only;
for another one becomes a wild beast, becomes a bird, <i>or</i> becomes
a serpent, with its lengthened body: this one, the Gods above call
Icelos; the tribe of mortals, Phobetor. There is likewise a third,
<i>master</i> of a different art, <i>called</i> Phantasos: he cleverly
changes <i>himself</i> into earth, and stone, and water, and a tree, and
all those things which are destitute of life. These are wont, by night,
to show their features to kings and to generals, <i>while</i> others
wander amid the people and the commonalty. These, Sleep, the aged
<i>God</i>, passes by, and selects Morpheus alone from all his brothers,
to execute the commands of the daughter of Thaumas; and again he
<span class = "pagenum">408</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 648-684.</span>
both drops his head, sunk in languid drowsiness, and shrinks back within
the lofty couch.</p>

<p><i>Morpheus</i> flies through the dark with wings that make no noise,
and in a short space of intervening time arrives at the Hæmonian city;
and, laying aside his wings from off his body, he assumes the form of
Ceyx; and in that form, wan, and like one without blood, without
garments, he stands before the bed of his wretched wife. The beard of
the hero appears to be dripping, and the water to be falling thickly
from his soaking hair. Then leaning on the bed, with tears running down
his face, he says these words: “My most wretched wife, dost thou
recognise <i>thy</i> Ceyx, or are my looks <i>so</i> changed with death?
Observe me; thou wilt <i>surely</i> know me: and, instead of thy
husband, thou wilt find the ghost of thy husband. Thy prayers, Halcyone,
have availed me nothing; I&nbsp;have perished. Do not promise thyself,
<i>thus</i> deceived, my <i>return</i>. The cloudy South wind caught my
ship in the Ægean Sea,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_54" id = "tag11_54"
href = "#note11_54">54</a> and dashed it to pieces, tossed by the mighty
blasts; and the waves choked my utterance, in vain calling upon thy
name. It is no untruthful messenger that tells thee this: thou dost not
hear these things through vague rumours. I, myself, shipwrecked, in
person, am telling thee my fate. Come, arise then, shed tears, and put
on mourning; and do not send me unlamented to the phantom <i>realms
of</i> Tartarus.”</p>

<p>To these words Morpheus adds a voice, which she may believe to be
that of her husband. He seems, too, to be shedding real tears, and his
hands have the gesture of Ceyx. As she weeps, Halcyone groans aloud, and
moves her arms in her sleep, and catching at his body, grasps the air;
and she cries aloud, “Stay, whither dost thou hurry? We will go
together.” Disturbed by her own voice, and by the appearance of her
husband, she shakes off sleep; and first she looks about there, to see
if he, who has been so lately seen, is there; for the servants, roused
by her voice, have brought in lights. After she has found him nowhere,
she smites her face with her hands, and tears her garments from off her
breast, and beats her breast itself. Nor cares she to loosen her hair;
she tears it, and says to her nurse, as she inquires what is the
occasion
<span class = "pagenum">409</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 684-715.</span>
of her sorrow: “Halcyone is no more! no more! with her own Ceyx is she
dead. Away with words of comfort. He has perished by shipwreck.
I&nbsp;have seen him, and I knew him; and as he departed, desirous to
detain him, I&nbsp;extended my hands towards him. The ghost fled: but,
yet it was the undoubted and the real ghost of my husband. It had not,
indeed, if thou askest me <i>that</i>, his wonted features; nor was he
looking cheerful with his former countenance. Hapless, I&nbsp;beheld
him, pale, and naked, and with his hair still dripping. Lo! ill-fated
<i>man</i>, he stood on this very spot;” and she seeks the prints of his
footsteps, if any are left. “This it was, this is what I dreaded in my
ill-boding mind, and I entreated that thou wouldst not, deserting me,
follow the winds. But, I&nbsp;could have wished, since thou didst depart
to perish, that, at least, thou hadst taken me as well. To have gone
with thee, <i>yes</i>, with thee, would have been an advantage to me;
for then neither should I have spent any part of my life otherwise than
together with thee, nor would my death have been divided <i>from
thee</i>. Now, absent <i>from thee</i>, I&nbsp;perish; now, absent,
I&nbsp;am tossed on the waves; and the sea has thee without&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>“My heart were more cruel than the sea itself, were I to strive to
protract my life any further; and, were I to struggle to survive so
great a misfortune. But I will not struggle, nor, hapless one, will I
abandon thee; and, at least, I&nbsp;will <i>now</i> come to be thy
companion. And, in the tomb, if the urn <i>does</i> not, yet the
inscription<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_55" id = "tag11_55" href =
"#note11_55">55</a> shall unite us: if <i>I&nbsp;touch</i> not thy bones
with my bones, still will I unite thy name with my name.” Grief forbids
her saying more, and wailings come between each word, and groans are
heaved from her sorrow-stricken breast.</p>

<p>It is <i>now</i> morning: she goes forth from her abode to the
sea-shore, and, wretched, repairs to that place from which she had seen
him go, and says, “While he lingered, and while he was loosening the
cables, at his departure, he gave me kisses upon this sea-shore;” and
while she calls to recollection the incidents which she had observed
with her eyes, and looks
<span class = "pagenum">410</span>
<span class = "linenum">xi. 715-747.</span>
out upon the sea, she observes on the flowing wave, I&nbsp;know not what
<i>object</i>, like a body, within a distant space: and at first she is
doubtful what it is. After the water has brought it a little nearer,
and, although it is <i>still</i> distant, it is plain that it is a
corpse. Ignorant who it may be, because it is ship-wrecked, she is moved
at the omen, and, though unknown, would fain give it a tear. “Alas! thou
wretched one!” she says, “whoever thou art; and if thou hast any wife!”
Driven by the waves, the body approaches nearer. The more she looks at
it, the less and the less is she mistress of her senses. And now she
sees it brought close to the land, that now she can well distinguish it:
it is her husband. “’Tis he!” she exclaims, and, on the instant, she
tears her face, her hair, <i>and</i> her garments; and, extending her
trembling hands towards Ceyx, she says, “And is it thus, Oh dearest
husband! is it thus, Oh ill-fated one! that thou dost return
to&nbsp;me?”</p>

<p>A mole, made by the hand of man, adjoins the waves, which breaks the
first fury of the ocean, and weakens the first shock of its waters. Upon
that she leaped, and ’tis wondrous that she could. She flew, and beating
the light air with her wings newly formed, she, a&nbsp;wretched bird,
skimmed the surface of the water. And, while she flew, her croaking
mouth, with its slender bill, uttered a sound like that of one in
sadness, and full of complaining. But when she touched the body, dumb,
and without blood, embracing the beloved limbs with her new-made wings,
in vain she gave him cold kisses with her hardened bill. The people were
in doubt whether Ceyx was sensible of this, or whether, by the motion of
the wave, he seemed to raise his countenance; but <i>really</i> he was
sensible of it; and, at length, through the pity of the Gods above, both
were changed into birds. Meeting with the same fate, even then their
love remained. Nor, when <i>now</i> birds, is the conjugal tie
dissolved: they couple, and they become parents; and for seven calm
days,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_56" id = "tag11_56" href =

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
According to the testimony of several of the ancient writers, Ceyx was
the king of Trachyn, and was a prince of great knowledge and experience;
and many had recourse to him to atone for the murders which they had
committed, whether through imprudence or otherwise. Pausanias says that
Eurystheus having summoned Ceyx to deliver up to him the children of
Hercules, that prince, who was not able to maintain a war against so
powerful a king, sent the youths to Theseus, who took them into his
protection.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
To recover from the melancholy consequent upon the death of his brother
Dædalion and his niece Chione, he went to Claros to consult the oracle
of Apollo, and was shipwrecked on his return; on which, his wife,
Halcyone, was so afflicted, that she died of grief, or else threw
herself into the sea, as Hyginus informs us. It was said that they were
changed into the birds which we call kingfishers, a&nbsp;story which,
probably, has no other foundation than the name of Halcyone, which
signifies that bird; which by the ancients was considered to be the
symbol of conjugal affection.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Apollodorus, however, does not give us so favourable an idea of the
virtue of these persons as Ovid has done. According to him, it was their
pride which proved the cause of their destruction. Jupiter enraged at
Ceyx, because he had assumed his name as Halcyone had done that of Juno,
changed them both into birds, he becoming a cormorant, and she a
kingfisher. This story is remarkable for the beautiful and affecting
manner in which it is told.</p>

shady Ida.</p>

<p>“He loathed the cities, and distant from the splendid court,
frequented the lonely mountains, and the unambitious fields; nor went
but rarely among the throngs of Ilium. Yet, not having a breast either
churlish, or impregnable to love, he espies Hesperie, the daughter of
Cebrenus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_61" id = "tag11_61" href =

shoulders, in the sun. The Nymph, <i>thus</i> seen, takes to flight,
just as the frightened hind from the tawny wolf; and <i>as</i> the
water-duck, surprised at a distance, having left her <i>wonted</i>
stream, from the hawk. Her the Trojan hero pursues, and, swift with
love, closely follows her, made swift by fear. Behold! a&nbsp;snake,
lurking in the grass, with its barbed sting, wounds her foot as she
flies, and leaves its venom in her body. With her flight is her life cut
short. Frantic, he embraces her breathless, and cries aloud,&mdash;
“I&nbsp;grieve, I&nbsp;grieve that <i>ever</i> I pursued <i>thee</i>.
But I did not apprehend this; nor was it of so much value to me to
conquer. We two have proved the destruction of wretched thee. The wound
was given by the serpent; by me was the occasion given. I&nbsp;should be
more guilty than he, did I not give the consolation for thy fate by my
own death.” <i>Thus</i> he said; and from a rock which the hoarse waves
had undermined, he hurled himself into the sea. Tethys, pitying him as
he fell, received him softly, and covered him with feathers as he swam
through the sea; and the power of obtaining

the death he sought was not granted to him. The lover is vexed that,
against his will, he is obliged to live on, and that opposition is made
to his spirit, desirous to depart from its wretched abode. And, as he
has assumed newformed wings on his shoulders, he flies aloft, and again
he throws his body in the waves: his feathers break the fall. Æsacus is
enraged; and headlong he plunges into the deep,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag11_62" id = "tag11_62" href = "#note11_62">62</a> and incessantly
tries the way of destruction. Love caused his leanness; the spaces
between the joints of his legs are long; his neck remains long,
<i>and</i> his head is far away from his body. He loves the sea, and has
his name because he plunges<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_63" id =

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid and Apollodorus agree that Æsacus was the son of Priam, and that he
was changed into a didapper, or diver, but they differ in the other
circumstances of his life. Instead of being the son of Alexirhoë,
Apollodorus says that he was the son of Priam and Arisbe the daughter of
Merope, his first wife; that his father made him marry Sterope, who
dying very young, he was so afflicted at her death, that he threw
himself into the sea. He also says that Priam having repudiated Arisbe
to marry Hecuba, the daughter of Cisseus, Æsacus seeing his
mother-in-law pregnant of her second son, foretold his father that her
progeny would be the cause of a bloody war, which would end in the
destruction of the kingdom of Troy; and that upon this prediction, the
infant, when born, was exposed on Mount Ida.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Tzetzes adds, that Æsacus told his father that it was absolutely
necessary to put to death both the mother and the infant which was born
on that same day; on which Priam being informed that Cilla, the wife of
Thymætes, being delivered on that day of a son, he ordered them both to
be killed; thinking thereby to escape the realization of the prediction.
Servius, on the authority of Euphorion, relates the story in much the
same manner; but a poet quoted by Cicero in his first book on
Divination, says that it was the oracle of Zelia, a&nbsp;little town at
the foot of Mount Ida, which gave that answer as an interpretation of
the dream of Hecuba. Pausanias says it was the sibyl Herophila who
interpreted the dream, while other ancient writers state that it was
Cassandra. Apollodorus says that Æsacus learned from his grandfather
Merops the art of foretelling things to come.</p>

<i>Doomed to die.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 26. The Romans were wont to exhibit
shows of hunting in the amphitheatre in the morning; and at mid-day the
gladiatorial spectacles commenced. The ‘arena’ was the name given to the
central open space, which derived its name from the sand with which it
was covered, chiefly for the purpose of absorbing the blood of the wild
beasts and of the combatants. Caligula, Nero, and Carus showed their
extravagant disposition by using cinnabar and borax instead of sand. In
the earlier amphitheatres there were ditches, called ‘Euripi,’ between
the open space, or arena, and the seats, to defend the spectators from
the animals. They were introduced by Julius Cæsar, but were filled up by
Nero, to gain space for the spectators. Those who fought with the beasts
(as it will be remembered St. Paul did at Ephesus) were either condemned
criminals or captives, or persons who did so for pay, being trained for
the purpose. Lucius Metellus was the first that we read of who
introduced wild beasts in the theatre for the amusement of the public.
He exhibited in the Circus one hundred and forty-two elephants, which he
brought from Sicily, after his victory over the Carthaginians, and which
are said to have been slain, more because the Romans did not know what
to do with them, than for the amusement of the public. Lions and
panthers were first exhibited by M.&nbsp;Fulvius, after the Ætolian war.
In the Circensian games, exhibited by the Curule Ædiles,
P.&nbsp;Cornelius Scipio Nasica, and P.&nbsp;Lentulus, <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> 168, there were sixty-three African panthers
and forty bears and elephants. These latter animals were sometimes
introduced to fight with bulls. Sylla, when Prætor, exhibited one
hundred lions, which were pierced with javelins. We also read of
hippopotami and crocodiles being introduced for the same purpose, while
cameleopards were also hunted in the games given by Julius Caesar in his
third consulship. He also introduced bull fights, and Augustus first
exhibited the rhinoceros, and a serpent, fifty cubits in length. When
Titus constructed his great amphitheatre, five thousand wild beasts and
four thousand tame animals were slain; while in the games celebrated by
Trajan, after his victories over the Dacians, eleven thousand animals
are said to have been killed. For further information on this subject,
the reader is referred to the article ‘Venatio,’ in Smith’s Dictionary
of Greek and Roman Antiquities, which valuable work contains a large
quantity of interesting matter on this barbarous practice of the
Romans.</p>

<i>The extreme summit.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 393. The upper stories of the
ancient light-houses had windows looking towards the sea; and torches,
or fires (probably in cressets, or fire-pans, at the end of poles), were
kept burning on them by night, to guide vessels. ‘Pharos,’ or ‘Pharus,’
the name given to light-houses, is derived from the celebrated one built
on the island of Pharos, at the entrance of the port of Alexandria. It
was erected by Sostratus, of Cnidos, at the expense of one of the
Ptolemies, and cost 800 talents. It was of huge dimensions, square, and
constructed of white stone. It contained many stories, and diminished in
width from below upwards. There were ‘phari,’ or ‘light-houses,’ at
Ostia, Ravenna, Capreæ, and Brundisium.</p>

<i>The <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Magnete’">Magnetes</ins>.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 408. The Magnetes were the
people of Magnesia, a&nbsp;district of Thessaly. They were famed for
their skill in horsemanship.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_32" id = "note11_32" href = "#tag11_32">32.</a>
<i>Hæmonian Acastus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 409. Acastus was the son of Pelias.
His wife Hippolyta, being enamoured of Peleus, and he not encouraging
her advances, she accused him of having made an attempt on her virtue.
On this, Acastus determined upon his death; and having taken him to
Mount Pelion, on the pretext of hunting, he took away his arms, and left
him there, to be torn to pieces by the wild beasts. Mercury, or,
according to some, Chiron, came to his assistance, and gave him a sword
made by Vulcan, with which he slew Acastus and his wife.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_18" id = "note11_18" href = "#tag11_18">18.</a>
<i>Embraces of Thetis.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 226. Fulgentius suggests, that
the meaning of this is, that Jupiter, or fire, will not unite with
Thetis, who represents water.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_19" id = "note11_19" href = "#tag11_19">19.</a>
<i>Son of Æacus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 227. Peleus was the son of Æacus, who
was the son of Jupiter, by Ægina, the daughter of Æsopus.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_20" id = "note11_20" href = "#tag11_20">20.</a>
<i>Upon its waters.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 247. While libations were made to
the other Divinities, either on their altars, or on the ground, the
marine Deities were so honoured by pouring wine on the waves of the
sea.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_21" id = "note11_21" href = "#tag11_21">21.</a>
<i>Carpathian.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 249. The Carpathian sea was so called
from the Isle of Carpathus, which lay between the island of Rhodes and
the Egyptian coast.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_22" id = "note11_22" href = "#tag11_22">22.</a>
<i>Trachinian land.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 269. Apollodorus says, that Peleus,
when exiled, repaired to Phthia, and not to the city of Trachyn.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_23" id = "note11_23" href = "#tag11_23">23.</a>
<i>Symbols of peace.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 276. The ‘velamenta’ were branches
of olive, surrounded with bandages of wool, which were held in the hands
of those who begged for mercy or pardon. The wool covering the hand was
emblematical of peace, the hand being thereby rendered powerless to
effect mischief.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_24" id = "note11_24" href = "#tag11_24">24.</a>
<i>Who summons forth.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 296. This is a periphrasis for
Lucifer, or the Morning Star, which precedes, and appears to summon the
dawn.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_25" id = "note11_25" href = "#tag11_25">25.</a>
<i>Thisbean doves.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 300. Thisbe was a town of Bœotia, so
called from Thisbe, the daughter of Æsopus. It was famous for the number
of doves which it produced.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_26" id = "note11_26" href = "#tag11_26">26.</a>

of Chione, being the father of Lucifer, and the grandfather of
Dædalion.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_28" id = "note11_28" href = "#tag11_28">28.</a>
<i>By our deeds.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 323. This is said sarcastically, as
much as to say, ‘If I do not please her by my looks, at least I will by
my actions.’</p>

<p><a name = "note11_29" id = "note11_29" href = "#tag11_29">29.</a>
<i>The Œtæan king.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 383. Namely, Ceyx, the king of
Trachyn, which city Hercules had founded, at the foot of Mount Œta.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_33" id = "note11_33" href = "#tag11_33">33.</a>
<i>The profane Phorbas.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 414. The temple at Delphi was
much nearer and more convenient for Ceyx to resort to; but at that
period it was in the hands of the Phlegyans, a&nbsp;people of Thessaly,
of predatory and lawless habits, who had plundered the Delphic shrine.
They were destroyed by thunderbolts and pestilence, or, according to
some authors, by Neptune, who swept them away in a flood. Phorbas, here
mentioned, was one of the Lapithæ, a&nbsp;savage robber, who forced
strangers to box with him, and then slew them. Having the presumption to
challenge the Gods, he was slain by Apollo.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_34" id = "note11_34" href = "#tag11_34">34.</a>
<i>Names upon tombs.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 429. Cenotaphs, or honorary tombs,
were erected in honour of those, who having been drowned, their bodies
could not be found. One great reason for erecting these memorials was
the notion, that the souls of those who had received no funeral honours,
wandered in agony on the banks of the Styx for the space of one hundred
years.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_35" id = "note11_35" href = "#tag11_35">35.</a>
<i>Hippotas.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 431. Æolus was the grandson of Hippotas,
through his daughter Sergesta, who bore Æolus to Jupiter. Ovid says that
he was the father of Halcyone; but, according to Lucian, she was the
daughter of Æolus the Hellenian, the grandson of Deucalion.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_36" id = "note11_36" href = "#tag11_36">36.</a>
<i>Brilliant fires.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 436. Ovid probably here had in view
the description given by Lucretius, commencing Book&nbsp;i. line
272.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_37" id = "note11_37" href = "#tag11_37">37.</a>
<i>In double rows.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 462. By this it is implied that the
ship of Ceyx was a ‘biremis,’ or one with two ranks of rowers; one rank
being placed above the other. Pliny the Elder attributes the invention
of the ‘biremis’ to the Erythræans. Those with three ranks of rowers
were introduced by the Corinthians; while Dionysius, the first king of
Sicily, was the inventor of the Quadriremis, or ship with four ranks of
rowers. Quinqueremes, or those with five ranks, are said to have been
the invention of the Salaminians. The first use of those with six ranks
has been ascribed to the Syracusans. Ships were sometimes built with
twelve, twenty, and even forty ranks of rowers, but they appear to have
been intended rather for curiosity than for use. As, of course, the
labour of each ascending rank increased, through the necessity of the
higher ranks using longer oars, the pay of the lowest rank was the
lowest, their work being the easiest. Where there were twenty ranks or
more, the upper oars required more than one man to manage them. Ptolemy
Philopater had a vessel built as a curiosity, which had no less than
four thousand rowers.</p>

<i>Towards their sides.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 475. ‘Obvertere lateri remos’
most probably means ‘To feather the oars,’ which it is especially
necessary to do in a gale, to avoid the retarding power of the wind
against the surface of the blade of the oar.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_39" id = "note11_39" href = "#tag11_39">39.</a>
<i>Fixes the sail-yards.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 476. ‘Cornua’ means, literally,
‘The ends or points of the sail-yards<ins class = "correction" title =
"’ missing">,’</ins> or ‘Antennæ:’ but here the word is used to signify
the sail-yards themselves.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_40" id = "note11_40" href = "#tag11_40">40.</a>
<i>Covering of wax.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 514. The ‘Cera’ with which the seams
of the ships were stopped, was most probably a composition of wax and
pitch, or other bituminous and resinous substances.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_41" id = "note11_41" href = "#tag11_41">41.</a>
<i>The tenth wave.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 530. This is said in allusion to the
belief that every tenth wave exceeded the others in violence.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_42" id = "note11_42" href = "#tag11_42">42.</a>
<i>Calls those happy.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 540. Those who died on shore would
obtain funeral rites; while those who perished by shipwreck might become
food for the fishes, a&nbsp;fate which was regarded by the ancients with
peculiar horror. Another reason for thus regarding death by shipwreck,
was the general belief among the ancients, that the soul was an
emanation from æther, or fire, and that it was contrary to the laws of
nature for it to be extinguished by water. Ovid says in his Tristia, or
Lament (Book I. El. 2, l. 51-57), ‘I fear not death: <ins class =
"correction" title = "’ invisible">’tis</ins> the dreadful kind of
death; Take away the shipwreck: then death will be a gain to me. ’Tis
something for one, either dying a natural death, or by the sword, to lay
his breathless corpse in the firm ground, and to impart his wishes to
his kindred, and to hope for a sepulchre, and not to be food for the
fishes of the sea.’</p>

<i>A hurricane.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 548-9. ‘Tanta vertigine pontus Fervet’
is transcribed by Clarke, ‘The sea is confounded with so great a
vertigo.’</p>

<p><a name = "note11_44" id = "note11_44" href = "#tag11_44">44.</a>
<i>The billows allow.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 566. ‘Quoties sinit hiscere
fluctus’ is rendered by Clarke, ‘As oft as the waves suffer him to
gape.’</p>

<p><a name = "note11_45" id = "note11_45" href = "#tag11_45">45.</a>
<i>A darkening arch.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 568. Possibly ‘niger arcus’ means a
sweeping wave, black with the sand which it has swept from the depths of
the ocean; or else with the reflection of the dark clouds.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_46" id = "note11_46" href = "#tag11_46">46.</a>
<i>From the heavens.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 571. The word Olympus is frequently
used by the poets to signify ‘the heavens;’ as the mountain of that name
in Thessaly, from its extreme height, was supposed to be the abode of
the Gods.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_47" id = "note11_47" href = "#tag11_47">47.</a>
<i>Prepare the garments.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 575. Horace tells us that their
clients wove garments for the Roman patricians; and the females of noble
family did the same for their husbands, children, and brothers. Ovid, in
the Fasti, describes Lucretia as making a ‘lacerna,’ or cloak, for her
husband Collatinus. She says to her hand-maidens, ‘With all speed there
must be sent to your master a cloak made with our hands.’ (Book&nbsp;ii.
l.&nbsp;746.) Suetonius tells us that Augustus would wear no clothes but
those made by his wife, sister, or daughter.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_48" id = "note11_48" href = "#tag11_48">48.</a>
<i>Polluted hands.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 584. All persons who had been engaged
in the burial of the dead were considered to be polluted, and were not
allowed to enter the temples of the Gods till they had been purified.
Among the Greeks, persons who had been supposed to have died in foreign
countries, and whose funeral rites had been performed in an honorary
manner by their own relatives, if it turned out that they were not dead,
and they returned to their own country, were considered impure, and were
only purified by being dressed in swaddling clothes, and treated like
new-born infants. We shall, then, be hardly surprised at Juno
considering Halcyone to be polluted by the death of her husband Ceyx,
although at a distance, and as yet unknown to her.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_49" id = "note11_49" href = "#tag11_49">49.</a>
<i>The Cimmerians.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 592. Ovid appropriately places the
abode of the drowsy God in the cold, damp, and foggy regions of the
Cimmerians, who are supposed, by some authors, to have been a people of
Sarmatia, or Scythia, near the Palus Mæotis, or sea of Azof. Other
writers suppose that a fabulous race of people, said to live near Baiæ
in Italy, and to inhabit dark caves throughout the day, while they
sallied forth to plunder at night, are here referred to. This
description of the abode of Sleep, and of his appearance and attendants,
is supposed to have been borrowed by Ovid from one of the Greek
poets.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_50" id = "note11_50" href = "#tag11_50">50.</a>
<i>Geese more sagacious.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 599. This is said in compliment
to the geese, for the service they rendered, in giving the alarm, and
saving the Capitol, when in danger of being taken by the Gauls.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_51" id = "note11_51" href = "#tag11_51">51.</a>
<i>Waters of Lethe.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 603. After the dead had tasted the
waters of Lethe, one of the rivers of Hell, it was supposed that they
lost all <ins class = "correction" title = "‘coll’ invisible">recollection</ins> of the events of their former life.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_52" id = "note11_52" href = "#tag11_52">52.</a>
<i>Took to flight.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 632. Clarke translates this line,
‘Away she scours, and returns through the bow through which she had
come.’</p>

<p><a name = "note11_53" id = "note11_53" href = "#tag11_53">53.</a>
<i>Morpheus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 635. Morpheus was so called from the Greek
<span class = "greek" title = "morphê">μορφὴ</span>, ‘shape,’ or
‘figure,’ because he assumed various shapes. Icelos has his name from
the Greek <span class = "greek" title = "ikelos">ἴκελος</span>, ‘like,’
for a similar reason. Phobetor is from the Greek <span class = "greek"
title = "phobos">φοβὸς</span>, ‘fear,’ because it was his office to
terrify mortals. Lucian appears to mean the same Deity, under the name
of Taraxion. Phantasos is from the Greek <span class = "greek" title =
"phantasos">φάντασις</span>, ‘fancy.’</p>

<p><a name = "note11_54" id = "note11_54" href = "#tag11_54">54.</a>
<i>In the Ægean Sea.</i>]&mdash;Ver<ins class = "correction" title = ", for .">. </ins>663. The Ægean Sea lay between the city of Trachyn and
the coast of Ionia, whither Ceyx had gone.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_55" id = "note11_55" href = "#tag11_55">55.</a>
<i>The inscription.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 706. The epitaphs on the tombs of
the ancients usually contained the name of the person, his age, and
(with the Greeks) some account of the principal events of his life.
Halcyone, in her affectionate grief, promises her husband, at least, an
honorary funeral, and a share in her own epitaph<ins class =

<p><a name = "note11_56" id = "note11_56" href = "#tag11_56">56.</a>
<i>Seven calm days.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 745. Simonides mentions eleven as
being the number of the days; Philochorus, nine; but Demagoras says
seven, the number here adopted by Ovid.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_57" id = "note11_57" href = "#tag11_57">57.</a>
<i>Floating on the sea.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 746. The male of the kingfisher
was said by the ancients to be so constant to his mate, that on her
death he refused to couple with any other, for which reason the poets
considered that bird as the emblem of conjugal affection. The sea was
supposed to be always calm when the female was sitting; from which time
of serenity, our proverb, which speaks of ‘Halcyon days,’ takes its
rise.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_58" id = "note11_58" href = "#tag11_58">58.</a>
<i>Some old man.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 749-50. ‘Hos aliquis
senior&mdash;spectat;’ these words are translated by Clarke, ‘Some old
blade spies them.’</p>

<p><a name = "note11_59" id = "note11_59" href = "#tag11_59">59.</a>
<i>Ganymede.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 756. Ovid need not have inserted Assaracus
and Ganymede, as they were only the brothers of Ilus, and the three were
the sons of Tros. Ilus was the father of Laomedon, whose son was Priam,
the father of Æsacus.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_60" id = "note11_60" href = "#tag11_60">60.</a>
<i>Granicus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 763. The Granicus was a river of Mysia,
near which Alexander the Great defeated Darius with immense
slaughter.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_61" id = "note11_61" href = "#tag11_61">61.</a>
<i>Cebrenus.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 769. The Cebrenus was a little stream of
Phrygia, not far from Troy.</p>

<p><a name = "note11_62" id = "note11_62" href = "#tag11_62">62.</a>
<i>Plunges into the deep.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 791-2. ‘Inque profundum Pronus
abit,’ Clarke renders, ‘Goes plumb down into the deep.’ Certainly this
is nearer to its French origin, ‘a plomb,’ than the present form, ‘plump
down;’ but, like many other instances in his translation, it decidedly
does not help us, as he professes to do, to ‘the attainment of the
elegancy of this great Poet.’</p>

<p><a name = "note11_63" id = "note11_63" href = "#tag11_63">63.</a>
<i>Because he plunges.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 795. He accounts for the Latin
name of the diver, or didapper, ‘mergus,’ by saying that it was so
called, ‘a mergendo,’ from its diving, which doubtless was the origin of
the name, though not taking its rise in the fiction here related by the
