INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> Metamorphoses of Ovid are a
compendium of the Mythological narratives of ancient Greece and Rome, so
ingeniously framed, as to embrace a large amount of information upon
almost every subject connected with the learning, traditions, manners,
and customs of antiquity, and have afforded a fertile field of
investigation to the learned of the civilized world. To present to the
public a faithful translation of a work, universally esteemed, not only
for its varied information, but as being the masterpiece of one of the
greatest Poets of ancient Rome, is the object of the present volume.</p>

<p>To render the work, which, from its nature and design, must, of
necessity, be replete with matter of obscure meaning, more inviting to
the scholar, and more intelligible to those who are unversed in
Classical literature, the translation is accompanied with Notes and
Explanations, which, it is believed, will be found to throw considerable
light upon the origin and meaning of some of the traditions of heathen
Mythology.</p>

<p>In the translation, the text of the Delphin edition has been
generally adopted; and no deviation has been made from it, except in a
few instances, where the reason for such a step is stated in the notes;
at the same time, the texts of Burmann and Gierig have throughout been
carefully consulted. The several editions vary materially in respect to
punctuation; the Translator has consequently used his own discretion in
adopting that which seemed to him the most fully to convey in each
passage the intended meaning of the writer.</p>

<p>The Metamorphoses of Ovid have been frequently translated into the
English language. On referring to Mr. Bohn’s excellent Catalogue of the
Greek and Latin Classics and their Translations, we find that the whole
of the work has been twice translated into English Prose, while five
translations in Verse are there enumerated. A&nbsp;prose version of the
Metamorphoses was published by Joseph Davidson<ins class = "correction"
title = ". for ,">, </ins>about the
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
middle of the last century, which professes to be “as near the original
as the different idioms of the Latin and English will allow;” and to be
“printed for the use of schools, as well as of private gentlemen.”
A&nbsp;few moments’ perusal of this work will satisfy the reader that it
has not the slightest pretension to be considered a literal translation,
while, by its departure from the strict letter of the author, it has
gained nothing in elegance of diction. It is accompanied by “critical,
historical, geographical, and classical notes in English, from the best
Commentators, both ancient and modern, beside a great number of notes,
entirely new;” but notwithstanding this announcement, these annotations
will be found to be but few in number, and, with some exceptions in the
early part of the volume, to throw very little light on the obscurities
of the text. A&nbsp;fifth edition of this translation was published so
recently as 1822, but without any improvement, beyond the furbishing up
of the old-fashioned language of the original preface. A&nbsp;far more
literal translation of the Metamorphoses is that by John Clarke, which
was first published about the year 1735, and had attained to a seventh
edition in 1779. Although this version may be pronounced very nearly to
fulfil the promise set forth in its title page, of being “as literal as
possible,” still, from the singular inelegance of its style, and the
fact of its being couched in the conversational language of the early
part of the last century, and being unaccompanied by any attempt at
explanation, it may safely be pronounced to be ill adapted to the
requirements of the present age. Indeed, it would not, perhaps, be too
much to assert, that, although the translator may, in his own words,
“have done an acceptable service to such gentlemen as are desirous of
regaining or improving the skill they acquired at school,” he has, in
many instances, burlesqued rather than translated his author. Some of
the curiosities of his version will be found set forth in the notes;
but, for the purpose of the more readily justifying this assertion,
a&nbsp;few of them are adduced: the word “nitidus” is always rendered
“neat,” whether applied to a fish, a&nbsp;cow, a&nbsp;chariot,
a&nbsp;laurel, the steps of a temple, or the art of wrestling. He
renders “horridus,” “in a rude pickle;” “virgo” is generally translated
“the young lady;” “vir” is “a&nbsp;gentleman;” “senex” and “senior” are
indifferently “the old blade,” “the old fellow,”
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
or “the old gentleman;” while “summa arx” is “the very tip-top.”
“Misera” is “poor soul;” “exsilio” means “to bounce forth;” “pellex” is
“a&nbsp;miss;” “lumina” are “the peepers;” “turbatum fugere” is “to
scower off in a mighty bustle;” “confundor” is “to be jumbled;” and
“squalidus” is “in a sorry pickle.” “Importuna” is “a&nbsp;plaguy
baggage;” “adulterium” is rendered “her pranks;” “ambages” becomes
either “a&nbsp;long rabble of words,” “a&nbsp;long-winded detail,” or
“a&nbsp;tale of a tub;” “miserabile carmen” is “a&nbsp;dismal ditty;”
“increpare hos” is “to rattle these blades;” “penetralia” means “the
parlour;” while “accingere,” more literally than elegantly, is
translated “buckle to.” “Situs” is “nasty stuff;” “oscula jungere” is
“to tip him a kiss;” “pingue ingenium” is a circumlocution for
“a&nbsp;blockhead;” “anilia instrumenta” are “his old woman’s
accoutrements;” and “repetito munere Bacchi” is conveyed to the sense of
the reader as, “they return again to their bottle, and take the other
glass.” These are but a specimen of the blemishes which disfigure the
most literal of the English translations of the Metamorphoses.</p>

<p class = "mynote">
The Clarke “translation” was published as part of a student edition
of Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, with the Latin on the top half of the
page, the English below. It was not intended as an independent
text.</p>

<p>In the year 1656, a little volume was published, by J[ohn]
B[ulloker,] entitled “Ovid’s Metamorphosis, translated grammatically,
and, according to the propriety of our English tongue, so far as grammar
and the verse will bear, written chiefly for the use of schools, to be
used according to the directions in the preface to the painfull
schoolmaster, and more fully in the book called, ‘Ludus Literarius, or
the Grammar school, chap. 8.’” Notwithstanding a title so pretentious,
it contains a translation of no more than the first 567 lines of the
first Book, executed in a fanciful and pedantic manner; and its rarity
is now the only merit of the volume. A&nbsp;literal interlinear
translation of the first Book “on the plan recommended by Mr. Locke,”
was published in 1839, which had been already preceded by
“a&nbsp;selection from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, adapted to the
Hamiltonian system, by a literal and interlineal translation,” published
by James Hamilton, the author of the Hamiltonian system. This work
contains selections only from the first six books, and consequently
embraces but a very small portion of the entire work.</p>

<p>For the better elucidation of the different fabulous narratives and
allusions, explanations have been added, which
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
are principally derived from the writings of Herodotus, Apollodorus,
Pausanias, Dio Cassius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Hyginus,
Nonnus, and others of the historians, philosophers, and mythologists of
antiquity. A&nbsp;great number of these illustrations are collected in
the elaborate edition of Ovid, published by the Abbé Banier, one of the
most learned scholars of the last century; who has, therein, and in his
“Explanations of the Fables of Antiquity,” with indefatigable labour and
research, culled from the works of ancient authors, all such information
as he considered likely to throw any light upon the Mythology and
history of Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>This course has been adopted, because it was considered that a
statement of the opinions of contemporary authors would be the most
likely to enable the reader to form his own ideas upon the various
subjects presented to his notice. Indeed, except in two or three
instances, space has been found too limited to allow of more than an
occasional reference to the opinions of modern scholars. Such being the
object of the explanations, the reader will not be surprised at the
absence of critical and lengthened discussions on many of those moot
points of Mythology and early history which have occupied, with no very
positive result, the attention of Niebuhr, Lobeck, Müller, Buttmann, and
many other scholars of profound learning.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">In</span> the mean time Minos besieges
Megara. Scylla, becoming enamoured of him, betrays her country, the
safety of which depends upon the purple lock of her father Nisu. Being
afterwards rejected by Minos, she clings to his ship, and is changed
into a bird, while her father becomes a sea eagle. Minos returns to
Crete, and having erected the Labyrinth with the assistance of Dædalus,
he there encloses the Minotaur, the disgrace of his family, and feeds it
with his Athenian captives. Theseus being one of these, slays the
monster: and having escaped from the Labyrinth by the aid of Ariadne, he
takes her with him, but deserts her in the isle of Dia, where Bacchus
meets with her, and places her crown among the Constellations. Dædalus
being unable to escape from the island of Crete, invents wings and flies
away; while Icarus, accompanying his father, is drowned. The partridge
beholds the father celebrating his funeral rites, and testifies his joy:
Perdix, or Talus, who had been envied by Minos for his ingenuity, and
had been thrown by him from the temple of Minerva, having been
transformed into that bird. Theseus, having now become celebrated, is
invited to the chase of the Calydonian boar, which Atalanta is the first
to wound. Meleager slays the monster; and his death is accelerated by
his mother Althæa, who places in the fire the fatal billet. Returning
from the expedition, Theseus comes to Acheloüs, and sees the islands
called the Echinades, into which the Naiads have been transformed.
Pirithoüs denies the possibility of this; but Lelex quotes, as an
example, the case of Baucis and Philemon, who were changed into trees,
while their house became a temple, and the neighbouring country a pool
of water. Acheloüs then tells the story of the transformations of
Proteus and of Metra,
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
and how Metra supported her father Erisicthon, while afflicted with
violent hunger.</p>


<h5><a name = "bell_synopsis_IX" id = "bell_synopsis_IX">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Acheloüs</span> then relates his own
transformations, when he was contending with Hercules for the hand of
Deïanira. Hercules wins her, and Nessus attempts to carry her off: on
which Hercules pierces him with one of his arrows that has been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra. In revenge, Nessus, as he is dying, gives to
Deïanira his garment stained with his blood. She, distrusting her
husband’s affection, sends him the garment; he puts it on, and his
vitals are consumed by the venom. As he is dying, he hurls his attendant
Lychas into the sea, where he becomes a rock. Hercules is conveyed to
heaven, and is enrolled in the number of the Deities. Alcmena, his
mother, goes to her daughter-in-law Iole, and tells her how Galanthis
was changed into a weasel; while she, in her turn, tells the story of
the transformation of her sister Dryope into the lotus. In the meantime
Iolaüs comes, whose youth has been restored by Hebe. Jupiter shows, by
the example of his sons Æacus and Minos, that all are not so blessed.
Miletus, flying from Minos, arrives in Asia, and becomes the father of
Byblis and Caunus. Byblis falls in love with her brother, and is
transformed into a fountain. This would have appeared more surprising to
all, if Iphis had not a short time before, on the day of her nuptials,
been changed into a man.</p>

then goes to those of Orpheus; but with a bad omen, as Eurydice dies
soon after, and cannot be brought to life. In his sorrow, Orpheus
repairs to the solitudes of the mountains, where the trees flock around
him at the sound of his lyre; and, among others, the pine, into which
Atys has been changed; and the cypress, produced from the transformation
of Cyparissus. Orpheus sings of the rape of Ganymede; of the change of
Hyacinthus, who was beloved and slain by Apollo, into a flower; of the
transformation of the Cerastæ into bulls; of the Propœtides, who were
changed into stones; and of the statue of Pygmalion, which was changed
into a living woman, who became the mother of Paphos. He then sings, how
Myrrha, for her incestuous intercourse with her father, was changed into
the myrrh tree; and how Adonis (to whom Venus relates the transformation
of Hippomenes and Atalanta into lions) was transformed into an
anemone.</p>

betakes himself to Phrygia; where Midas, for his care of Silenus,
receives the power of making gold. He loathes this gift; and bathing in
the river Pactolus, its sands become golden. For his stupidity, his ears
are changed by Apollo into those of an ass. After this, that God goes to
Troy, and aids Laomedon in building its walls. Hercules rescues his
daughter Hesione, when fastened to a rock, and his companion Telamon
receives her as his wife; while his brother Peleus marries the sea
Goddess, Thetis. Going to visit Ceyx, he learns how Dædalion has been
changed into a hawk, and sees a wolf changed into a rock. Ceyx goes to
consult the oracle of Claros, and perishes by shipwreck. On this,
Morpheus appears to Halcyone, in the form of her husband, and she is
changed into a kingfisher; into which bird Ceyx is also transformed.

where they see a serpent changed into stone, and prepare to sacrifice
Iphigenia to Diana; but a hind is substituted for her. The Trojans
hearing of the approach of the Greeks, in arms await their arrival. At
the first onset, Cygnus, dashed by Achilles against a stone, is changed
by Neptune into the swan, a&nbsp;bird of the same name, he having been
vulnerable by no weapon. At the banquet of the chiefs, Nestor calls to
mind Cæneus, who was also invulnerable; and who having been changed from
a woman into a man, on being buried under a heap of trees, was
transformed into a bird. This Cæneus was one of the Lapithæ, at the
battle of whom with the Centaurs, Nestor was present. Nestor also tells
how his brother, Periclymenus, was changed into an eagle. Meanwhile,
Neptune laments the death of Cygnus, and entreats Apollo to direct the
arrow of Paris against the heel of Achilles, which is done, and that
hero is slain.</p>

men into apes, he comes to Italy; and landing near the spot which he
calls Caicta, he learns from Macareus many particulars respecting
Ulysses and the incantations of Circe, and how king Picus was changed
into a woodpecker. He afterwards wages war with Turnus. Through Venulus,
Turnus asks assistance of Diomedes, whose companions have been
transformed into birds, and he is refused. Venulus, as he returns, sees
the spot where an Apulian shepherd had been changed into an olive tree.
The ships of Æneas, when on fire, become sea Nymphs, just as a heron

Egeria laments the death of Numa, and will not listen to the
consolations of Hippolytus, who tells her of his own transformation, and
she pines away into a fountain. This is not less wonderful, than how
Tages sprang from a clod of earth; or how the lance of Romulus became a
tree; or how Cippus became decked with horns. The Poet concludes by
passing to recent events; and after shewing how Æsculapius was first
worshipped by the Romans, in the sacred isle of the Tiber, he relates
the Deification of Julius Cæsar and his change into a Star; and
foretells imperishable fame for himself.</p>

More about the text</a></h5>

<p>Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, translated by Henry Thomas Riley
(1816-1878, B.A. 1840, M.A. 1859), was originally published in 1851 as
part of Bohn’s Classical Library. This e-text, covering Books VIII-XV,
is
based on the 1893 George Bell reprint (London, 1893, one volume). The
edition describes itself as “reprinted from the stereotype plates”.
These may have been the original 1851 plates; the <i>Classical
Library</i> was sold to Bell &amp; Daldy, later George Bell.</p>

<h5><a name = "lines" id = "lines">
Line Numbers</a></h5>

<p>Line numbers from the Latin poem&mdash;not its prose
translation&mdash;were printed as headnotes on each page. In this
e-text, line numbers appear in the left margin, across from the page
numbers. Line numbers used in footnotes are retained from the original
text; these, too, refer to the Latin poem and are independent of line
divisions in the translation.</p>

Errors and Inconsistencies</a></h5>

<p>Typographical errors have been marked with <ins class = "correction"
title = "like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>, with a few exceptions:</p>

<p>Hyphenization is inconsistent&mdash;for example, the forms “sea
monster” and “sea-monster” both occur&mdash;and is not marked unless one
form is clearly anomalous. Errors and omissions in Greek diacritical
marks have been silently corrected.</p>


<h5><a name = "names" id = "names">
Variant Names</a></h5>

<p>This is not intended to be a complete list.</p>

<p>Dieresis is unpredictable; forms such as “Alcathöe” and “Pirithöus”
are common, and have been silently corrected. Since the ligatures “æ”
and “œ” are used consistently, dieresis in “oe” and “ae” can be assumed
even when not explicitly indicated.</p>

<p>Treatment of names in <b>Ia-</b> (pronounced as two syllables) is
inconsistent. <b>Iäsion</b> and <b>Iänthe</b> are regularly written with
dieresis, while <b>Iarbas</b>, <b>Iapyx</b>, <b>Iapygia</b> are written
without.</p>

<p>The forms “Lapithean” and “Lapithæan” both occur.</p>

<p>The “Lilybœus” of Books I-VII is now correctly written “Lilybæus”,
but <b>Erysichthon</b> (with y or upsilon) is written “Erisicthon”.</p>

<p>As in Books I-VII, spellings in “-cth-” (Erisicthon, Erectheus)
are used consistently in place of “-chth-” (-χθ-). Similarly, Phaëthon
is written “Phaëton”.</p>

Footnote Numbering</a></h5>

<p>Numbers begin from 1 in each Book. Almost all Books had duplications
in the sequence, usually in the form “17*”; some had omissions. In this

without duplication. Simple printing errors, such as missing or
incorrect tags, have been marked where they occur in the text, and are
not listed here.</p>
