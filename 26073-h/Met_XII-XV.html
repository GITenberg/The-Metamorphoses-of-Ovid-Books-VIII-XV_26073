<span class = "smallcaps">The</span> Greeks assemble their troops at
Aulis, to proceed against the city of Troy, and revenge the rape of
Helen; but the fleet is detained in port by contrary winds. Calchas, the
priest, after a prediction concerning the success of the expedition,
declares that the weather will never be favourable till Agamemnon shall
have sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia. She is immediately led to the
altar for that purpose; but Diana, appeased by this act of obedience,
carries away the maiden, and substitutes a hind in her place, on which a
fair wind arises. Upon the Greeks landing at Troy, a&nbsp;battle is
fought, in which Protesilaüs is killed by Hector, and Achilles kills
Cygnus, a&nbsp;Trojan, on which his father Neptune transforms him into a
swan.</p>

<p>His father Priam mourned him, not knowing that Æsacus, having assumed
wings, was <i>still</i> living; Hector, too, with his brothers, made
unavailing offerings<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_1" id = "tag12_1"
href = "#note12_1">1</a> at a tomb, that bore his name <i>on it</i>. The
presence of Paris was wanting, at this mournful office: who, soon after,
brought into his country a lengthened war, together with a ravished
wife;<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_2" id = "tag12_2" href =
"#note12_2">2</a> and a thousand ships<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_3"
id = "tag12_3" href = "#note12_3">3</a> uniting together, followed him,
and, together <i>with them</i>, the whole body<a class = "tag" name =
"tag12_4" id = "tag12_4" href = "#note12_4">4</a> of the Pelasgian
nation. Nor would vengeance have been delayed, had not the raging winds
made the seas impassable, and the Bœotian land detained in fishy Aulis
the ships ready to depart. Here, when they had prepared a
<span class = "pagenum">415</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 11-44.</span>
sacrifice to Jupiter, after the manner of their country, as the ancient
altar was heated with kindled fires, the Greeks beheld an azure-coloured
serpent creep into a plane tree, which was standing near the sacrifice
they had begun. There was on the top of the tree a nest of twice four
birds, which the serpent seized<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_5" id =
"tag12_5" href = "#note12_5">5</a> together, and the dam as she
fluttered around <i>the scene of</i> her loss, and he buried them in his
greedy maw. All stood amazed. But <i>Calchas</i>, the son of Thestor,
a&nbsp;soothsayer, foreseeing the truth, says, “Rejoice, Pelasgians, we
shall conquer. Troy will fall, but the continuance of our toil will be
long;” and he allots the nine birds to the years of the war. <i>The
serpent</i>, just as he is, coiling around the green branches in the
tree, becomes a stone, and, under the form of a serpent, retains that
stone <i>form</i>.</p>

<p>Nereus continued boisterous in the Ionian waves, and did not impel
the sails onwards; and there are some who think that Neptune favoured
Troy, because he made the walls of the city. But not <i>so</i> the son
of Thestor. For neither was he ignorant, nor did he conceal, that the
wrath of the virgin Goddess must be appeased by the blood of a virgin.
After the public good had prevailed over affection, and the king over
the father, and Iphigenia, ready to offer her chaste blood, stood before
the altar, while the priests were weeping; the Goddess was appeased, and
cast a mist before their eyes, and, amid the service and the hurry of
the rites, and the voices of the suppliants, is said to have changed
Iphigenia, the Mycenian maiden, for a substituted hind. Wherefore, when
the Goddess was appeased by a death which was <i>more</i> fitting, and
at the same moment the wrath of Phœbe, and of the sea was past, the
thousand ships received the winds astern, and having suffered much, they
gained the Phrygian shore.</p>

<p>There is a spot in the middle of the world, between the land and the
sea, and the regions of heaven, the confines of the threefold universe,
whence is beheld whatever anywhere exists, although it may be in far
<i>distant</i> regions, and every sound pierces the hollow ears. <i>Of
this place</i> Fame is possessed, and chooses for herself a habitation
on the top<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_6" id = "tag12_6" href =
"#note12_6">6</a> of a tower, and

has added innumerable avenues, and a thousand openings to her house, and
has closed the entrances with no gates. Night and day are they open. It
is all of sounding brass; it is all resounding, and it reechoes the
voice, and repeats what it hears. Within there is no rest, and silence
in no part. Nor yet is there a clamour, but the murmur of a low voice,
such as is wont to arise from the waves of the sea, if one listens at a
distance, or like the sound which the end of the thundering <i>makes</i>
when Jupiter has clashed the black clouds together. A&nbsp;crowd
occupies the hall; the fickle vulgar come and go; and a thousand
rumours, false mixed with true, wander up and down, and circulate
confused words. Of these, some fill the empty ears with conversation;
some are carrying elsewhere what is told them; the measure of the
fiction is ever on the increase, and each fresh narrator adds something
to what he has heard. There, is Credulity, there, rash Mistake, and
empty Joy, and alarmed Fears, and sudden Sedition, and Whispers of
doubtful origin. She sees what things are done in heaven and on the sea,
and on the earth; and she pries into the whole universe.</p>

<p>She has made it known that Grecian ships are on their way, with
valiant troops: nor does the enemy appear in arms unlooked for. The
Trojans oppose their landing, and defend the shore, and thou,
Protesilaüs,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_7" id = "tag12_7" href =
"#note12_7">7</a> art, by the decrees of fate, the first to fall by the
spear of Hector;<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_8" id = "tag12_8" href =
"#note12_8">8</a> and the battles <i>now</i> commenced, and the
courageous spirits of <i>the Trojans</i>, and Hector, <i>till then</i>
unknown, cost the Greeks dear. Nor do the Phrygians experience at small
expense of blood what the Grecian right hand can do. And now the Sigæan
shores are red <i>with blood</i>: now Cygnus, the son of Neptune, has
slain a thousand men. Now is Achilles pressing on in his chariot, and
levelling the Trojan ranks, with the blow of his Peleian spear; and
seeking through the lines either Cygnus or Hector, he engages with
Cygnus: Hector is reserved for the tenth year. Then animating the
horses, having their
<span class = "pagenum">417</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 78-105.</span>
white necks pressed with the yoke, he directed his chariot against the
enemy, and brandishing his quivering spear with his arm, he said,
“O&nbsp;youth, whoever thou art, take this consolation in thy death,
that thou art slain by the Hæmonian Achilles.”</p>

<p>Thus far the grandson of Æacus. His heavy lance followed his words.
But, although there was no missing in the unerring lance, yet it availed
nothing, by the sharpness of its point, <i>thus</i> discharged; and as
it only bruised his breast with a blunt stroke, <i>the other</i> said,
“Thou son of a Goddess, (for by report have we known of thee beforehand)
why art thou surprised that wounds are warded off from me? (for
<i>Achilles</i> was surprised); not this helmet that thou seest tawny
with the horse’s mane, nor the hollowed shield, the burden of my left
arm, are assistant to me; from them ornament <i>alone</i> is sought; for
this cause, too, Mars is wont to take up arms. All the assistance of
defensive armour shall be removed, <i>and</i> yet I shall come off
unhurt. It is something to be born, not of a Nereid,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag12_9" id = "tag12_9" href = "#note12_9">9</a> but <i>of
one</i> who rules both Nereus and his daughter, and the whole
ocean.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> he spoke; and he hurled against the descendant of Æacus
his dart, destined to stick in the rim of his shield; it broke through
both the brass and the next nine folds of bull’s hide; but stopping in
the tenth circle <i>of the hide</i>, the hero wrenched it out, and again
hurled the quivering weapon with a strong hand; again his body was
without a wound, and unharmed, nor was a third spear able <i>even</i> to
graze Cygnus, unprotected, and exposing himself. Achilles raged no
otherwise than as a bull,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_10" id =
"tag12_10" href = "#note12_10">10</a> in the open Circus,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag12_11" id = "tag12_11" href = "#note12_11">11</a> when
with his dreadful horns he butts against the purple-coloured garments,
used as the means of provoking him, and perceives that his wounds are
evaded. Still, he examines whether the point has chanced to fall
<span class = "pagenum">418</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 105-132.</span>
from off the spear. It is <i>still</i> adhering to the shaft. “My hand
then is weak,” says he, “and it has spent <i>all</i> the strength it had
before, upon one man. For decidedly it was strong enough, both when at
first I overthrew the walls of Lyrnessus, or when I filled both Tenedos
and Eëtionian<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_12" id = "tag12_12" href =
"#note12_12">12</a> Thebes with their own blood. Or when Caÿcus<a class
= "tag" name = "tag12_13" id = "tag12_13" href = "#note12_13">13</a>
flowed empurpled with the slaughter of its people: and Telephus<a class
= "tag" name = "tag12_14" id = "tag12_14" href = "#note12_14">14</a> was
twice sensible of the virtue of my spear. Here, too, where so many have
been slain, heaps of whom I both have made along this shore, and I
<i>now</i> behold, my right hand has proved mighty, and is mighty.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> he spoke; and as if he distrusted what he had done
before, he hurled his spear against Menœtes, one of the Lycian
multitude,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_15" id = "tag12_15" href =
"#note12_15">15</a> who <i>was</i> standing opposite, and he tore
asunder both his coat of mail, and his breast beneath it. He beating the
solid earth with his dying head, he drew the same weapon from out of the
reeking wound, and said, “This is the hand, this the lance, with which I
conquered but now. The same will I use against him; in his <i>case</i>,
I&nbsp;pray that the event may prove the same.” Thus he said, and he
hurled it at Cygnus, nor did the ashen lance miss him; and, not escaped
<i>by him</i>, it resounded on his left shoulder: thence it was
repelled, as though by a wall, or a solid rock. Yet Achilles saw Cygnus
marked with blood, where he had been struck, and he rejoiced, <i>but
in</i> vain. There was no wound; that was the blood of Menœtes.</p>

<p>Then indeed, raging, he leaps headlong from his lofty chariot, and
hand to hand, with his gleaming sword striking at his fearless foe, he
perceives that the shield and the helmet are pierced with his sword, and
that his weapon, too, is blunted upon his hard body. He endures it no
longer; and drawing back his
<span class = "pagenum">419</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 133-145.</span>
shield, he three or four times strikes the face of the hero, and his
hollow temples, with the hilt of the sword; and following, he presses
onward as the other gives ground, and confounds him, and drives him on,
and gives him no respite in his confusion. Horror seizes on him, and
darkness swims before his eyes; and as he moves backwards his retreating
steps, a&nbsp;stone in the middle of the field stands in his way.
Impelled over this, with his breast upwards, Achilles throws Cygnus with
great violence, and dashes him<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_16" id =
"tag12_16" href = "#note12_16">16</a> to the earth. Then, pressing down
his breast with his shield and his hard knees, he draws tight the straps
of his helmet; which, fastened beneath his pressed chin, squeeze close
his throat, and take away his respiration and the passage of his
breath.</p>

<p>He is preparing to strip his vanquished <i>foe</i>; he sees
<i>nothing but</i> his armour, left behind. The God of the Ocean changed
his body into a white bird, of which he <i>so</i> lately bore the
name.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
It is not improbable that the prediction of Calchas, at Aulis, that the
war against Troy would endure nine years, had no other foundation than
his desire to check an enterprise which must be attended with much
bloodshed, and difficulties of the most formidable nature. It is not
unlikely, too, that this interpretation of the story of the serpent
devouring the birds may have been planned by some of the Grecian
generals, who did not dare openly to refuse their assistance to
Agamemnon. The story of Iphigenia was, perhaps, founded on a similar
policy. The ancient poets and historians are by no means agreed as to
the fate of Iphigenia, as some say that she really was sacrificed, while
others state that she was transformed into a she-bear, others into an
old woman, and Nicander affirms that she was changed into a heifer.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
There is no story more celebrated among the ancients than that of the
intended immolation of Iphigenia. Euripides wrote two tragedies on the
subject. Homer, however, makes no allusion to the story of Iphigenia;
but he mentions Iphianassa, the daughter of Agamemnon, who was sent for,
to be a hostage on his reconciliation with Achilles; she is probably the
same person that is meant by the later poets, under the name of
Iphigenia.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It has been suggested by some modern commentators, that the story of
Iphigenia was founded on the sacrifice of his own daughter, by Jeptha,
the judge of Israel, which circumstance happened much about the same
time. The story of the substitution of the hind for the damsel, when
about to be slain, was possibly founded on the substituted offering for
Isaac when about to be offered by his father; for it is not probable
that the people
<span class = "pagenum">420</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘174-206’">146</ins>.</span>
of Greece were entirely ignorant of the existence of the books of Moses,
and that wonderful narrative would be not unlikely to make an impression
on minds ever ready to be attracted by the marvellous. Some writers have
taken pains to show that Agamemnon did not sacrifice, or contemplate
sacrificing, his own daughter, by asserting that the Iphigenia here
mentioned was the daughter of Helen, who was educated by Clytemnestra,
the wife of Agamemnon, and the sister of Helen. Pausanias also adopts
this view, and gives for his authorities Euphorion of Chalcis,
Alexander, Stesichorus, and the people of Argos, who preserved a
tradition to the same effect.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Lucretius, Virgil, and Diodorus Siculus are in the number of those who
assert that Iphigenia actually was immolated. According to Dictys the
Cretan, and several of the ancient scholiasts, Ulysses having left the
Grecian camp without the knowledge of Agamemnon, went to Argos, and
returned with Iphigenia, under the pretext that her father intended to
marry her to Achilles. Some writers state that Achilles was in love with
Iphigenia; and that he was greatly enraged at Ulysses for bringing her
to the camp, and opposed her sacrifice to the utmost of his power.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid then proceeds to recount the adventures of the Greeks, after their
arrival at Troy. An oracle had warned the Greeks, that he who should be
the first to land on the Trojan shores, would inevitably be slain.
Protesilaüs seeing that this prediction damped the courage of his
companions, led the way, and sacrificed his life for the safety of his
friends, being slain by Hector immediately on his landing. Cygnus,
signalizing himself by his bravery, attracted the attention of Achilles,
who singled him out as a worthy antagonist. It was said that this hero
was the son of Neptune; perhaps because he was powerful by sea, and the
prince of some island in the Archipelago. He was said to be
invulnerable, most probably because his shield was arrow-proof. The
story of his transformation into a swan, has evidently no other
foundation than the resemblance between his name and that of that
bird.</p>

<p class = "synopsis">
<span class = "smallcaps">A truce</span> ensuing, the Grecian chiefs
having assembled at a feast, express their surprise at the fact of
Cygnus being invulnerable. Nestor, by way of showing a still more
surprising instance, relates how the Nymph Cænis, the daughter of
Elatus, having yielded to the caresses of Neptune, was transformed by
him into a man, and made invulnerable. Cæneus being present at the
wedding feast of Pirithoüs, the son of Ixion, where Eurytus was a guest,
the latter, being elevated with wine, made an attempt upon Hippodamia,
the bride; on which a quarrel arose between the Centaurs and the
Lapithæ. After many on both sides had been slain, Cæneus still remained
unhurt; on which, the Centaurs having heaped up trunks of trees upon
him, he was pressed to death; Neptune then changed his body into a
bird.</p>

<p>This toil<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_17" id = "tag12_17" href =

days; and both sides rested, laying aside their arms. And while a
watchful guard was keeping the Phrygian walls, and a watchful guard was
keeping the Argive trenches, a&nbsp;festive day had arrived, on which
Achilles, the conqueror of Cygnus, appeased Pallas with the blood of a
heifer, adorned with fillets. As soon as he had placed its entrails<a
class = "tag" name = "tag12_18" id = "tag12_18" href =
"#note12_18">18</a> upon the glowing altars, and the smell, acceptable
to the Deities, mounted up to the skies, the sacred rites had their
share, the other part was served up at the table. The chiefs reclined on
couches, and sated their bodies with roasted flesh,<a class = "tag" name
= "tag12_19" id = "tag12_19" href = "#note12_19">19</a> and banished
both their cares and their thirst with wine. No harps, no melody of
voices,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_20" id = "tag12_20" href =
"#note12_20">20</a> no long pipe of boxwood pierced with many a hole,
delights them; but in discourse they pass the night, and valour is the
subject-matter of their conversation. They relate the combats of the
enemy and their own; and often do they delight to recount, in turn, both
the dangers that they have encountered and that they have surmounted.
For of what <i>else</i> should Achilles speak? or of what, in
preference, should they speak before the great Achilles? <i>But</i>
especially the recent victory over the conquered Cygnus was the subject
of discourse. It seemed wonderful to them all, that the body of the
youth was penetrable by no weapon, and was susceptible of no wounds, and
that it blunted the steel itself. This same thing, the grandson of
Æacus, this, the Greeks wondered&nbsp;at.</p>

<p>When thus Nestor says <i>to them</i>: “Cygnus has been the only
despiser of weapons in your time, and penetrable by no blows. But I
myself formerly saw the Perrhæbean<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_21" id
= "tag12_21" href = "#note12_21">21</a> Cæneus bear a thousand blows
with his body unhurt; Cæneus the Perrhæbean, <i>I&nbsp;say</i>, who,
famous for his achievements, inhabited Othrys. And that this, too, might
be the more wondrous in

<span class = "linenum">xii. <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘239-266’">174-205</ins>.</span>
him, he was born a woman.” They are surprised, whoever are present, at
the singular nature of this prodigy, and they beg him to tell the story.
Among them, Achilles says, “Pray tell us, (for we all have the same
desire to hear it,) O&nbsp;eloquent old man,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag12_22" id = "tag12_22" href = "#note12_22">22</a> the wisdom of our
age; who was <i>this</i> Cæneus, <i>and</i> why changed to the opposite
sex? in what war, and in the engagements of what contest was he known to
thee? by whom was he conquered, if he was conquered by any one?”</p>

<p>Then the aged man <i>replied</i>: “Although tardy old age is a
disadvantage to me, and many things which I saw in my early years escape
me <i>now</i>, yet I remember most <i>of them</i>; and there is nothing,
amid so many transactions of war and peace, that is more firmly fixed in
my mind than that circumstance. And if extended age could make any one a
witness of many deeds, I&nbsp;have lived two hundred<a class = "tag"
name = "tag12_23" id = "tag12_23" href = "#note12_23">23</a> years,
<i>and</i> now my third century is being passed <i>by me</i>. Cænis, the
daughter of Elatus, was remarkable for her charms; the most beauteous
virgin among the Thessalian maids, and one sighed for in vain by the
wishes of many wooers through the neighbouring <i>cities</i>, and
through thy cities, Achilles, for she was thy countrywoman. Perhaps,
too, Peleus would have attempted that alliance; but at that time the
marriage of thy mother had either befallen him, or had been promised
him. Cænis did not enter into any nuptial ties; and as she was walking
along the lonely shore, she suffered violence from the God of the ocean.
’Twas thus that report stated; and when Neptune had experienced the
pleasures of this new amour, he said, ‘Be thy wishes secure from all
repulse; choose whatever thou mayst desire.’ The same report has related
this too; Cænis replied, ‘This mishap makes my desire extreme, that I
may not be in a condition to suffer any such thing <i>in future</i>.
Grant that I be no <i>longer</i> a woman, <i>and</i> thou wilt have
granted me all.’ She spoke these last words with a hoarser tone, and the

wish; and had granted moreover that he should not be able to be pierced

privilege, the Atracian<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_24" id =

time in manly exercises, and roamed over the Peneïan plains.
<i>Pirithoüs</i>, the son of the bold Ixion, had married Hippodame,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag12_25" id = "tag12_25" href =
"#note12_25">25</a> and had bidden the cloud-born monsters to sit down
at the tables ranged in order, in a cave shaded with trees. The Hæmonian
nobles were there; I, too, was there, and the festive palace resounded
with the confused rout. Lo! they sing the marriage song, and the halls
smoke with the fires;<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_26" id = "tag12_26"
href = "#note12_26">26</a> the maiden, too, is there, remarkable for her
beauty, surrounded by a crowd of matrons and newly married women. We
<i>all</i> pronounce Pirithoüs fortunate in her for a wife; an omen
which we had well nigh falsified. For thy breast, Eurytus, most savage
of the savage Centaurs, is inflamed as much with wine as with seeing the
maiden; and drunkenness, redoubled by lust, holds sway <i>over thee</i>.
On the sudden the tables being overset, disturb the feast, and the bride
is violently dragged away by her seized hair. Eurytus snatches up
Hippodame, <i>and</i> the others such as each one fancies, or is able
<i>to seize</i>; and there is <i>all</i> the appearance of a captured
city. The house rings with the cries of women. Quickly we all rise; and
first, Theseus says, ‘What madness, Eurytus, is impelling thee, who,
while I <i>still</i> live, dost provoke Pirithoüs, and, in thy
ignorance, in one dost injure two?’ And that the valiant hero may not
say these things in vain, he pushes them off as they are pressing on,
and takes her whom they have seized away from them as they grow
furious.</p>

<p>“He says nothing in answer, nor, indeed, can he defend such actions
by words; but he attacks the face of her protector with insolent hands,
and strikes his generous breast. By chance, there is near at hand an
ancient bowl, rough with projecting figures, which, huge as it is, the
son of Ægeus, himself huger <i>still</i>, takes up and hurls full in his
face. He, vomiting

both from his wounds and his mouth clots of blood,<a class = "tag" name

wine together, lying on his back, kicks on the soaking sand. <i>The</i>
double-limbed<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_28" id = "tag12_28" href =
"#note12_28">28</a> <i>Centaurs</i> are inflamed at the death of their
brother; and all vying, with one voice exclaim, ‘To arms! to arms!’ Wine
gives them courage, and, in the first onset, cups hurled are flying
about, and shattered casks<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_29" id =
"tag12_29" href = "#note12_29">29</a> and hollow cauldrons; things
before adapted for a banquet, now for war and slaughter. First, the son
of Ophion, Amycus, did not hesitate to spoil the interior of the house
of its ornaments; and first, from the shrine he tore up a chandelier,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag12_30" id = "tag12_30" href =
"#note12_30">30</a> thick set with blazing lamps; and lifting it on
high, like him who attempts to break the white neck of the bull with
sacrificial axe, he dashed it against the forehead of Celadon the
Lapithean, and left his skull mashed into his face, no <i>longer</i> to
be recognized. His eyes started out, and the bones of his face being
dashed to pieces, his nose was driven back, and was fixed in the middle
of his palate. Him, Belates the Pellæan, having torn away the foot of a
maple table, laid flat on the ground, with his chin sunk upon his
breast, and vomiting forth his teeth mixed with blood; and sent him, by
a twofold wound, to the shades of Tartarus.</p>

<p>“As Gryneus stood next, looking at the smoking altar with a grim
look, he said, ‘<i>And</i> why do we not make use of this?’ and
<i>then</i> he raised an immense altar, together with its fire; and
hurled it into the midst of the throng of the Lapithæ, and struck down
two <i>of them</i>, Broteus and Orius. The mother of Orius was Mycale,
who was known by her incantations to have often drawn down the horns of
the struggling moon. <i>On this</i> Exadius says, ‘Thou shalt not go
unpunished, if only the opportunity of getting a weapon is given me;’
and, as his weapon,
<span class = "pagenum">425</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 266-299.</span>
he wields the antlers of a votive stag,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag12_31" id = "tag12_31" href = "#note12_31">31</a> which were upon a
lofty pine-tree. With the double branches of these, Gryneus is pierced
through the eyes, and has those eyes scooped out. A&nbsp;part of them
adheres to the antlers, a&nbsp;part runs down his beard, and hangs down
clotted with gore. Lo! Rhœtus snatches up an immense flaming brand, from
the middle of the altar, and on the right side breaks through the
temples of Charaxus, covered with yellow hair. His locks, seized by the
violent flames, burn like dry corn, and the blood seared in the wound
emits a terrific noise in its hissing, such as the iron glowing in the
flames is often wont to emit, which, when the smith has drawn it out
with the crooked pincers, he plunges into the trough; whereon it
whizzes, and, sinking in the bubbling water, hisses. Wounded, he shakes
the devouring fire from his locks, and takes upon his shoulders the
threshold, torn up out of the ground, a&nbsp;<i>whole</i> waggon-load,
which its very weight hinders him from throwing full against the foe.
The stony mass, too, bears down Cometes, a&nbsp;friend, who is standing
at a short distance; nor does Rhœtus <i>then</i> restrain his joy,
<i>and</i> he says, ‘In such manner do I pray that the rest of the
throng of thy party may be brave;’ and <i>then</i> he increases the
wound, redoubled with the half-burnt stake, and three or four times he
breaks the sutures of his head with heavy blows, and its bones sink
within the oozing brains.</p>

<p>“Victorious, he passes on to Evagrus, and Corythus, and Dryas; of
which <i>number</i>, when Corythus, having his cheeks covered<a class =
"tag" name = "tag12_32" id = "tag12_32" href = "#note12_32">32</a> with
their first down, has fallen, Evagrus says, ‘What glory has been
acquired by thee, in killing a boy?’ Rhœtus permits him to say no more,
and fiercely thrusts the glowing flames into the open mouth of the hero,
as he is speaking, and through the mouth into the breast. Thee, too,
cruel Dryas, he pursues, whirling the fire around his head, but the same
issue does not await thee as well. Thou piercest him with a stake burnt
at the end, while triumphing in the success of an
<span class = "pagenum">426</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 299-328.</span>
uninterrupted slaughter, in the spot where the neck is united to the
shoulder. Rhœtus groans aloud, and with difficulty wrenches the stake
out of the hard bone, and, drenched in his own blood, he flies. Orneus
flies, too, and Lycabas, and Medon, wounded in his right shoulder-blade,
and Thaumas with Pisenor; Mermerus, too, who lately excelled all in
speed of foot, <i>but</i> now goes more slowly from the wound he has
received; Pholus, too, and Melaneus, and Abas a hunter of boars, and
Astylos the augur, who has in vain dissuaded his own party from this
warfare. He also says to Nessus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_33" id =
"tag12_33" href = "#note12_33">33</a> as he dreads the wounds, ‘Fly not!
<i>for</i> thou shalt be reserved for the bow of Hercules.’ But
Eurynomus and Lycidas, and Areos, and Imbreus did not escape death, all
of whom the right hand of Dryas pierced right through. Thou, too,
Crenæus, didst receive a wound in front,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag12_34" id = "tag12_34" href = "#note12_34">34</a> although thou
didst turn thy back in flight; for looking back, thou didst receive the
fatal steel between thy two eyes, where the nose is joined to the lower
part of the forehead. In the midst of so much noise, Aphidas was lying
fast asleep from the wine which he had drunk incessantly, and was not
aroused, and in his languid hand was grasping the mixed bowl, stretched
at full length upon the shaggy skin of a bear of Ossa. Soon as Phorbas
beheld him from afar, wielding no arms, he inserted his fingers in the
strap of his lance,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_35" id = "tag12_35"
href = "#note12_35">35</a> and said, ‘Drink thy wine mingled with <i>the
water of</i> Styx;’ and, delaying no longer, he hurled his javelin
against the youth, and the ash pointed with steel was driven into his
neck, as, by chance, he lay <i>there</i> on his back. His death happened
without his being sensible of it; and the blood flowed from his full
throat, both upon the couch and into the bowl itself.</p>

<p>“I saw Petræus endeavouring to tear up an acorn-bearing oak from the
earth; <i>and</i>, as he was grasping it in his embrace,
<span class = "pagenum">427</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 328-364.</span>
and was shaking it on this side and that, and was moving about the
loosened tree, the lance of Pirithoüs hurled at the ribs of Petræus,
transfixed his struggling breast together with the tough oak. They said,
<i>too</i>, that Lycus fell by the valour of Pirithoüs, <i>and</i> that
Chromis fell <i>by the hand</i> of Pirithoüs. But each of them
<i>gave</i> less glory to the conqueror, than Dictys and Helops gave.
Helops was transfixed by the javelin, which passed right through his
temples, and, hurled from the right side, penetrated to his left ear.
Dictys, slipping from the steep point of a rock, while, in his fear, he
is flying from the pursuing son of Ixion, falls down headlong, and, by
the weight of his body, breaks a huge ash tree, and spits his own
entrails upon it, <i>thus</i> broken. Aphareus advances <i>as</i> his
avenger, and endeavours to hurl a stone torn away from the mountain. As
he is endeavouring <i>to do so</i>, the son of Ægeus attacks him with an
oaken club, and breaks the huge bones of his arm, and has neither
leisure, nor, <i>indeed</i>, does he care to put his useless body to
death; and he leaps upon the back of the tall Bianor, not used to bear<a
class = "tag" name = "tag12_36" id = "tag12_36" href =
"#note12_36">36</a> any other than himself; and he fixes his knees in
his ribs, and holding his long hair, seized with his left hand, shatters
his face, and his threatening features, and his very hard temples, with
the knotty oak. With his oak, <i>too</i>, he levels Nedymnus, and
Lycotas the darter, and Hippasus having his breast covered with his
flowing beard, and Ripheus, who towered above the topmost woods, and
Tereus, who used to carry home the bears, caught in the Hæmonian
mountains, alive and raging.</p>

<p>“Demoleon could not any longer endure Theseus enjoying this success
in the combat, and he tried with vast efforts to tear up from the
thick-set wood an aged pine; because he could not effect this, he hurled
it, broken short, against his foe. But Theseus withdrew afar from the
approaching missile, through the warning of Pallas; so <i>at least</i>
he himself wished it to be thought. Yet the tree did not fall without
effect: for it struck off from the throat of the tall Crantor, both his
breast and his left shoulder. He, Achilles, had been the armour-bearer
of thy father: him Amyntor, king of the Dolopians,<a class = "tag" name
= "tag12_37" id = "tag12_37" href = "#note12_37">37</a>
<span class = "pagenum">428</span>

when conquered in war, had given to the son of Æacus, as a pledge and
confirmation of peace. When Peleus saw him at a distance, mangled with a
foul wound, he said, ‘Accept however, Crantor, most beloved of youths,
this sacrifice;’ and, with a strong arm, and energy of intention, he
hurled his ashen lance against Demoleon, which broke through the
enclosures of his ribs, and quivered, sticking amid the bones. He draws
out with his hand the shaft without the point; even that follows, with
much difficulty; the point is retained within his lungs. The very pain
gives vigour to his resolution; <i>though</i> wounded, he rears against
the enemy, and tramples upon the hero with his horse’s feet. The other
receives the re-echoing strokes upon his helmet and his shield, and
defends his shoulders, and holds his arms extended before him, and
through the shoulder-blades he pierces two breasts<a class = "tag" name
= "tag12_38" id = "tag12_38" href = "#note12_38">38</a> at one stroke.
But first, from afar, he had consigned to death Phlegræus, and Hyles; in
closer combat, Hiphinoüs and Clanis. To these is added Dorylas, who had
his temples covered with a wolf’s skin, and the real horns of oxen
reddened with much blood, that performed the duty of a cruel weapon.</p>

<p>“To him I said, for courage gave me strength, ‘Behold, how much thy
horns are inferior to my steel;’ and <i>then</i> I threw my javelin.
When he could not avoid this, he held up his right hand before his
forehead, about to receive the blow; <i>and</i> to his forehead his hand
was pinned. A&nbsp;shout arose; but Peleus struck him delaying, and
overpowered by the painful wound, (for he was standing next to him) with
his sword beneath the middle of his belly. He leaped forth, and fiercely
dragged his own bowels on the ground, and trod on them <i>thus</i>
dragged, and burst them <i>thus</i> trodden; and he entangled his legs,
as well in them, and fell down, with his belly emptied <i>of its inner
parts</i>. Nor did thy beauty, Cyllarus,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag12_39" id = "tag12_39" href = "#note12_39">39</a> save thee while
fighting, if only we allow beauty to that <i>monstrous</i> nature <i>of
thine</i>. His beard was beginning <i>to grow</i>; the colour of his
beard was that of gold; and golden-coloured hair was hanging from his
shoulders to the middle of his shoulder-blades. In his face there was a
pleasing briskness; his neck, and his
<span class = "pagenum">429</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 397-435.</span>
shoulders, and his hands, and his breast <i>were</i> resembling the
applauded statues of the artists, and <i>so</i> in those parts in which
he was a man; nor was the shape of the horse beneath that <i>shape</i>,
faulty and inferior to <i>that of</i> the man. Give him <i>but</i> the
neck and the head <i>of a horse, and</i> he would be worthy of Castor.
So fit is his back to be sat upon, so stands his breast erect with
muscle; <i>he is</i> all over blacker than black pitch; yet his tail is
white; the colour, too, of his legs is white. Many a female of his own
kind longed for him; but Hylonome alone gained him, than whom no female
more handsome lived in the lofty woods, among the half beasts. She alone
attaches Cyllarus, both by her blandishments, and by loving, and by
confessing that she loves him. Her care, too, of her person is as great
as can be in those limbs: so that her hair is smoothed with a comb; so
that she now decks herself with rosemary, now with violets or roses,
<i>and</i> sometimes she wears white lilies; and twice a day she washes
her face with streams that fall from the height of the Pagasæan wood;
<i>and</i> twice she dips her body in the stream: and she throws over
her shoulder or her left side no skins but what are becoming, and are
those of choice beasts.</p>

<p>“Their love was equal: together they wandered upon the mountains;
together they entered the caves; and then, too, together had they
entered the Lapithæan house; together were they waging the fierce
warfare. The author <i>of the deed</i> is unknown: <i>but</i> a javelin
came from the left side, and pierced thee, Cyllarus, below <i>the
spot</i> where the breast is joined to the neck. The heart, being
pierced with a small wound, grew cold, together with the whole body,
after the weapon was drawn out. Immediately, Hylonome receives his dying
limbs, and cherishes the wound, by laying her hand on it, and places her
mouth on his, and strives to stop the fleeting life. When she sees him
dead, having uttered what the clamour hinders from reaching my ears, she
falls upon the weapon that has pierced him, and as she dies, embraces
her husband. He, too, <i>now</i> stands before my eyes, Phæocomes,
<i>namely</i>, who had bound six lions’ skins together with connecting
knots; covered all over, both horse and man. He, having discharged the
trunk of a tree, which two yokes of oxen joined together could hardly
have moved, battered the son of Phonolenus on the top of his head. The
very broad round form of his skull was broken; and through his mouth,
and
<span class = "pagenum">430</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 435-464.</span>
through his hollow nostrils, and his eyes, and his ears, his softened
brains poured down; just as curdled milk is wont through the oaken
twigs, or as <i>any</i> liquor flows under the weight of a well-pierced
sieve, and is squeezed out thick through the numerous holes. But I,
while he was preparing to strip him of his arms as he lay, (this thy
sire knows,) plunged my sword into the lower part of his belly, as he
was spoiling him. Chthonius, too, and Teleboas, lay <i>pierced</i> by my
sword. The former was bearing a two-forked bough <i>as his weapon</i>,
the latter a javelin; with his javelin he gave me a wound. You see the
marks; look! the old scar is still visible.</p>

<p>“Then ought I<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_40" id = "tag12_40" href
= "#note12_40">40</a> to have been sent to the taking of Troy; then I
might, if not have overcome, <i>still</i> have stayed the arms of the
mighty Hector. But at that time Hector was not existing, or <i>but</i> a
boy; <i>and</i> now my age is failing. Why tell thee of Periphas, the
conqueror of the two-formed Pyretus? Why of Ampyx, who fixed his
cornel-wood spear, without a point, full in the face of the four-footed
Oëclus? Macareus, struck down the Pelethronian<a class = "tag" name =

driving a crowbar into his breast. I&nbsp;remember, too, that a hunting
spear, hurled by the hand of Nessus, was buried in the groin of Cymelus.
And do not believe that Mopsus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_43" id =
"tag12_43" href = "#note12_43">43</a> the son of Ampycus, only foretold
things to come; a&nbsp;two-formed <i>monster</i> was slain by Mopsus,
darting <i>at him</i>, and Odites in vain attempted to speak, his tongue
being nailed to his chin, and his chin to his throat. Cæneus had put
five to death, Stiphelus, and Bromus, and Antimachus, and Helimus, and
Pyracmos, wielding the axe. I&nbsp;do not remember <i>their
respective</i> wounds, <i>but</i> I marked their numbers, and their
names. Latreus, most huge both in his limbs and his body, sallied forth,
armed with the spoils of Emathian<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_44" id =
"tag12_44" href = "#note12_44">44</a> Halesus, whom he had consigned to
death. His age was between that of a youth, and an old man;
<span class = "pagenum">431</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 465-494.</span>
his vigour that of a youth; grey hairs variegated his temples.
Conspicuous by his buckler, and his helmet, and his Macedonian pike;<a
class = "tag" name = "tag12_45" id = "tag12_45" href =
"#note12_45">45</a> and turning his face towards both sides, he
brandished his arms, and rode in one same round, and vaunting, poured
forth thus many words into the yielding air:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘And shall I put up with thee, too, Cænis? for to me thou shalt ever
be a woman, to me always Cænis. Does not thy natal origin lower thy
<i>spirit</i>? And does it not occur to thy mind for what <i>foul</i>
deed thou didst get thy reward, and at what price the false resemblance
to a man? Consider both what thou wast born, as well as what thou hast
submitted to: go, and take up a distaff together with thy baskets, and
twist the threads<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_46" id = "tag12_46" href
= "#note12_46">46</a> with thy thumb; leave warfare to men.’ As he is
vaunting in such terms, Cæneus pierces his side, stretched in running,
with a lance hurled at him, just where the man is joined to the horse.
He raves with pain, and strikes at the exposed face of the Phylleian
<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_47" id = "tag12_47" href =
"#note12_47">47</a> youth with his pike. It bounds back no otherwise
than hail from the roof of a house; or than if any one were to beat a
hollow drum with a little pebble. Hand to hand he encounters him, and
strives to plunge his sword into his tough side; <i>but</i> the parts
are impervious to his sword. ‘Yet,’ says he, ‘thou shalt not escape me;
with the middle of the sword shalt thou be slain, since the point is
blunt;’ and <i>then</i> he slants the sword against his side, and grasps
his stomach with his long right arm. The blow produces an echo, as on a
body of marble when struck; and the shivered blade flies different ways,
upon striking his neck.</p>

<p>“After Cæneus had enough exposed his unhurt limbs to him in his
amazement, ‘Come now,’ said he, ‘let us try thy body with my steel;’ and
up to the hilt he plunged his fatal sword into his shoulder-blade, and
extended his hand unseen into his entrails, and worked it about, and in
the wound made a <i>fresh</i> wound. Lo! the double-limbed
<i>monsters,</i> enraged, rush on
<span class = "pagenum">432</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 494-533.</span>
in an impetuous manner, and all of them hurl and thrust their weapons at
him alone. Their weapons fall blunted. Unstabbed and bloodless the
Elateïan Cæneus remains from each blow. This strange thing makes them
astonished. ‘Oh great disgrace!’ cries Monychus; ‘a <i>whole</i> people,
we are overcome by one, and that hardly a man; although, <i>indeed</i>,
he is a man; and we by our dastardly actions, are what he <i>once</i>
was. What signify our huge limbs? What our twofold strength? What that
our twofold nature has united in us the stoutest animals in existence?
I&nbsp;neither believe that we are born of a Goddess for our mother, nor
of Ixion, who was so great a person, that he conceived hopes of
<i>even</i> the supreme Juno. By a half male foe are we baffled. Heap
upon him stones and beams, and entire mountains, and dash out his
long-lived breath, by throwing <i>whole</i> woods <i>upon him</i>. Let a
<i>whole</i> wood press on his jaws; and weight shall be in the place of
wounds.’</p>

<p>“<i>Thus</i> he said; and by chance having got a tree, thrown down by
the power of the boisterous South wind, he threw it against the powerful
foe: and he was an example <i>to the rest</i>; and in a short time,
Othrys, thou wast bare of trees, and Pelion had no shades. Overwhelmed
by this huge heap, Cæneus swelters beneath the weight of the trees, and
bears on his brawny shoulders the piled-up oaks. But after the load has
increased upon his face and his head, and his breath has no air to draw;
at one moment he faints, at another he endeavours, in vain, to raise
himself into the <i>open</i> air, and to throw off the wood cast <i>upon
him</i>: and sometimes he moves it. Just as lo! we see, if lofty Ida is
convulsed with earthquakes. The event is doubtful. Some gave out that
his body was hurled to roomy Tartarus by the weight of the wood. The son
of Ampycus denied this, and saw go forth into the liquid air, from amid
the pile, a&nbsp;bird with tawny wings; which then was beheld by me for
the first time, then, <i>too</i>, for the last. When Mopsus saw it with
gentle flight surveying his camp, and making a noise around it with a
vast clamour, following him both with his eyes and his feelings, he
said, ‘Hail! thou glory of the Lapithæan race, once the greatest of men,
but now the only bird <i>of thy kind</i>, Cæneus.’ This thing was
credited from its assertor. Grief added resentment, and we bore it with
disgust, that one was overpowered by foes so
<span class = "pagenum">433</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 533-535.</span>
many. Nor did we cease to exercise our weapons, in <i>shedding their</i>
blood, before a part of them was put to death, and flight and the night
dispersed the rest.”</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
We learn from Diodorus Siculus, and other ancient authors, that the
people of Thessaly, and those especially who lived near Mount Pelion,
were the first who trained horses for riding, and used them as a
substitute for chariots. Pliny the Elder says that they excelled all the
other people of Greece in horsemanship, and that they carried it to such
perfection, that the name of <span class = "greek" title =
"hippeus">ἱππεὺς</span>, ‘a horseman,’ and that of ‘Thessalian,’ became
synonymous. Again, the Thessalians, from their dexterity in killing the
wild bulls that infested the neighbouring mountains, sometimes with
darts or spears, and at other times in close engagement, acquired the
name of Hippocentaurs, that is, ‘horsemen that hunted bulls,’ or simply
<span class = "greek" title = "kentauroi">κένταυροι</span>,
‘Centaurs.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is not improbable that, because the Thessalians began to practise
riding in the reign of Ixion, the poets made the Centaurs his sons; and
they were said to have a cloud for their mother, which Jupiter put in
the place of Juno, to baulk the attempt of Ixion on her virtue, because,
according to Palæphatus, many of them lived in a city called Nephele,
which, in Greek, signifies a cloud. As another method of accounting for
their alleged descent from a cloud, it has been suggested that the
Centaurs were a rapacious race of men, who ravaged the neighbouring
country: that those who wrote the first accounts of them, in the ancient
dialect of Greece, gave them the name of Nephelim, (the epithet of the
giants of Scripture,) many Phœnician words having been imported in the
early language of that country; and that in later times, finding them
called by this name, the Greek word Nephelè, signifying ‘a cloud,’
persons readily adopted the fable that they were born of one.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Centaurs being the descendants of Centaurus, the son of Ixion, and
Pirithoüs being also the son of Ixion, by Dia, the former, declared war
against Pirithoüs, asserting, that, as the descendants of Ixion, they
had a right to share in the succession to his dominions. This quarrel,
however, was made up, and they continued on friendly terms, until the
attempt of Eurytus, or Eurytion, on Hippodamia, the bride of Pirithoüs,
which was followed by the consequences here described by Ovid. The
Centaurs are twice mentioned in the Iliad as <span class = "greek" title
= "phêres">φῆρες</span>, or ‘wild beasts,’ and once under the name of
‘Centaurs.’ Pindar is the first writer that mentions them as being of a
twofold form, partly man, and partly horse. In the twenty-first Book of
the Odyssey, line 295, Eurytion is said to have had his ears and nose
cut off by way of punishment, and that, from that period, ‘discord arose
between the Centaurs and men.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Buttman, (Mythologus, ii. p. 22, as quoted by Mr. Keightley), says that
the names of Centaurs and Lapithæ are two purely poetic names, used to
designate two opposite races of men,&mdash;the former, the rude
horse-riding tribes, which tradition records to have been spread over
the north of Greece: the latter, the more civilized race, which founded
towns, and gradually drove their wild neighbours back into the
mountains. He thinks
<span class = "pagenum">434</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 536-541.</span>
that the explanation of the word ‘Centaurs,’ as ‘Air-piercers,’ (from
<span class = "greek" title = "kentein tên auran">κεντεῖν τὴν
αὔραν</span>) not an improbable one, for the idea is suggested by the
figure of a Cossack leaning forward with his protruded lance as he
gallops along. But he regards the idea of <span class = "greek" title =
"kentauros">κένταυρος</span>, having been in its origin simply <span
class = "greek" title = "kentôr">κέντωρ</span>, as much more probable,
[it meaning simply ‘the spurrer-on.’] Lapithæ may, he thinks, have
signified ‘Stone persuaders,’ from <span class = "greek" title = "laas peithein">λᾶας πείθειν</span>, a&nbsp;poetic appellation for the
builders of towns. He supposes Hippodamia to have been a Centauress,
married to the prince of the Lapithæ, and thus accounts for the Centaurs
having been at the wedding. Mr. Keightley, in his ‘Mythology of Ancient
Greece and Italy,’ remarks that ‘it is certainly not a little strange
that a rude mountain race like the Centaurs should be viewed as
horsemen; and the legend which ascribes the perfecting of the art of
horsemanship to the Lapithæ, is unquestionably the more probable one.
The name Centaur, which so much resembles the Greek verb <span class =
"greek" title = "kenteô">κεντέω</span>, ‘to spur,’ we fancy gave origin
to the fiction. This derivation of it is, however, rather dubious.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
After the battle here described, the Centaurs retreated to the mountains
of Arcadia. The Lapithæ pursuing them, drove them to the Promontory of
Malea in Laconia, where, according to Apollodorus, Neptune took them
into his protection. Servius and Antimachus, as quoted by Comes Natalis,
say that some of them fled to the Isle of the Sirens (or rather to that
side of Italy which those Nymphs had made their abode); and that there
they were destroyed by the voluptuous and debauched lives they led.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The fable of Cæneus, which Ovid has introduced, is perhaps simply
founded on the prodigious strength and the goodness of the armour of a
person of that name. The story of Halyonome killing herself on the body
of Cyllarus, may possibly have been handed down by tradition. It is not
unlikely that, if the Centaurs were horsemen, their women were not
unacquainted with horsemanship; indeed, representations of female
Centaurs are given, on ancient monuments, as drawing the chariot of
Bacchus.</p>

<p>As the Pylian related this fight between the Lapithæ and the
Centaurs, <i>but</i> half human, Tlepolemus<a class = "tag" name =
"tag12_48" id = "tag12_48" href = "#note12_48">48</a> could not endure
his sorrow for Alcides being passed by with silent lips, and said, “It
is strange, old man, that thou shouldst have a <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘forgetfuless’">forgetfulness</ins> of the exploits
of Hercules; at least, my father himself used often
<span class = "pagenum">435</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 541-576.</span>
to relate to me, that these cloud-begotten <i>monsters</i> were
conquered by him.” The Pylian, sad at this, said, “Why dost thou force
me to call to mind my misfortunes, and to rip up my sorrows, concealed
beneath years, and to confess my hatred of, and disgust at, thy father?
He, indeed, ye Gods! performed things beyond all belief, and filled the
world with his services; which I could rather wish could be denied; but
we are in the habit of praising neither Deiphobus nor Polydamas,<a class
= "tag" name = "tag12_49" id = "tag12_49" href = "#note12_49">49</a> nor
Hector himself: for who would commend an enemy? That father of thine
once overthrew the walls of Messene, and demolished guiltless cities,
Elis and Pylos, and carried the sword and flames into my abode. And,
that I may say nothing of others whom he slew, we were twice six sons of
Neleus, goodly youths; the twice six fell by the might of Hercules,
myself alone excepted. And that the others were vanquished might have
been endured; <i>but</i> the death of Periclymenus is wonderful; to whom
Neptune, the founder of the Neleian family, had granted to be able to
assume whatever shapes he might choose, and again, when assumed, to lay
them aside. He, after he had in vain been turned into all other shapes,
was turned into the form of the bird that is wont to carry the
lightnings in his crooked talons, the most acceptable to the king of the
Gods. Using the strength of <i>that</i> bird, his wings, and his crooked
bill, together with his hooked talons, he tore the face of the hero. The
Tirynthian hero aims at him his bow, too unerring, and hits him, as he
moves his limbs aloft amid the clouds, and hovering <i>in the air</i>,
just where the wing is joined to the side.</p>

<p>“Nor is the wound a great one, but his sinews, cut by the wound, fail
him, and deny him motion and strength for flying. He fell down to the
earth, his weakened pinions not catching the air; and where the smooth
arrow had stuck in his wing, it was pressed <i>still further</i> by the
weight of his pierced body, and it was driven, through the upper side,
into the left part of the neck. Do I seem to be owing encomiums to the
exploits of thy <i>father</i> Hercules, most graceful leader of the
Rhodian fleet?<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_50" id = "tag12_50" href =

than by being silent on his brave deeds: with thyself I have a firm
friendship.” After the son<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_51" id =
"tag12_51" href = "#note12_51">51</a> of Neleus had said these things
with his honied tongue, the gifts of Bacchus being resumed after the
discourse of the aged man, they arose from their couches: the rest of
the night was given to sleep.</p>

<p>But the God who commands the waters of the sea with his trident,
laments, with the affection of a father, the body of his son, changed
into the bird of the son of Sthenelus; and abhorring the ruthless
Achilles, pursues his resentful wrath in more than an ordinary manner.
And now, the war having been protracted for almost twice five years,
with such words as these he addresses the unshorn Smintheus:<a class =
"tag" name = "tag12_52" id = "tag12_52" href = "#note12_52">52</a>
“O&nbsp;thou, most acceptable to me, by far, of the sons of my brother,
who, together with me, didst build the walls of Troy in vain; and dost
thou not grieve when thou lookest upon these towers so soon to fall? or
dost thou not lament that so many thousands are slain in defending these
walls? and (not to recount them all) does not the ghost of Hector,
dragged around his Pergamus, recur to thee? Though still the fierce
Achilles, more blood-stained than war itself, lives on, the destroyer of
our toil, let him but put himself in my power, I&nbsp;will make him feel
what I can do with my triple spear. But since it is not allowed us to
encounter the enemy in close fight, destroy him, when off his guard,
with a secret shaft.”</p>

<p>He nodded his assent; and the Delian <i>God</i>, indulging together
both his own resentment and that of his uncle, veiled in a cloud, comes
to the Trojan army, and in the midst of the slaughter of the men, he
sees Paris, at intervals, scattering his darts among the ignoble Greeks;
and, discovering himself to be a Divinity, he says, “Why dost thou waste
thy arrows upon
<span class = "pagenum">437</span>
<span class = "linenum">xii. 602-628.</span>
the blood of the vulgar? If thou hast any concern for thy friends, turn
upon the grandson of Æacus, and avenge thy slaughtered brothers.”
<i>Thus</i> he said; and pointing at the son of Peleus, mowing down the
bodies of the Trojans with the sword, he turned his bow towards him, and
directed his unerring arrow with a fatal right hand. This was <i>the
only thing</i> at which, after <i>the death of</i> Hector, the aged
Priam could rejoice. And art thou then, Achilles, the conqueror of men
so great, conquered by the cowardly ravisher of a Grecian wife? But if
it had been fated for thee to fall by the hand of a woman, thou wouldst
rather have fallen by the Thermodontean<a class = "tag" name =

<p>Now that dread of the Phrygians, the glory and defence of the
Pelasgian name, the grandson of Æacus, a&nbsp;head invincible in war,
had been burnt: the same Divinity had armed him,<a class = "tag" name =

him. He is now <i>but</i> ashes; and there remains of Achilles, so
renowned, I&nbsp;know not what; that which will not well fill a little
urn. But his glory lives, which can fill the whole world: this allowance
is befitting that hero, and in this the son of Peleus is equal to
himself, and knows not the empty Tartarus. Even his very shield gives
occasion for war, that you may know to whom it belongs; and arms are
wielded for arms. The son of Tydeus does not dare to claim them, nor
Ajax, the son of Oïleus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_55" id =

<p class = "explanation">
Periclymenus was the son of Neleus and Chloris, as we are told by
<span class = "pagenum">438</span>
Homer, Apollodorus, and other authors. According to these authors,
Neleus, king of Orchomenus, was the son of Neptune, who assumed the form
of the river Enipeus, the more easily to deceive Tyro, the daughter of
Salmoneus. Neleus married Chloris, the daughter of Amphion, king of
Thebes, who bore him eleven sons and one daughter, of which number,
Homer names but three. Periclymenus, the youngest of the family, was a
warlike prince, and, according to Apollodorus, accompanied Jason in the
expedition of the Argonauts. Hercules, after having instituted the
Olympic games, marched into Messenia, and declared war with Neleus. The
ancient writers differ as to the cause of this expedition; but they
agree in stating, that Hercules made himself master of Pylos,
a&nbsp;town which Neleus had built, as a refuge from the capricious
humours of his brother Pelias; and that Neleus and all his children were
killed, except Nestor, who had been brought up among the Geranians, and
who afterwards reigned in Pylos. The story which here relates how
Periclymenus transformed himself into an eagle, and was then killed by
Hercules, may possibly mean, that having long resisted the attacks of
his formidable enemy, he was at length put to flight, and slain by an
arrow. It is said that Neptune had given him the power to metamorphose
himself into different figures, very probably because his grandfather,
who was a maritime prince, had taught him the art of war and various
stratagems, which he industriously made use of, to avert the ruin of his
family.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
In relation to the story of the death of Achilles, Dictys the Cretan
tells us, that Achilles having seen Polyxena, the daughter of Priam,
along with Cassandra, as she was sacrificing to Apollo, fell in love
with her, and demanded her in marriage and that Hector would not consent
to it, except on condition of his betraying the Greeks. This demand, so
injurious to his honour, provoked Achilles so much, that he forthwith
slew Hector, and dragged his body round the walls of the city. He
further says that when Priam went to demand the body of Hector, he took
Polyxena with him, in order to soften Achilles. His design succeeded,
and Priam then agreed to give her to him in marriage. On the day
appointed for the solemnity in the temple of Apollo, Paris, concealing
himself behind the altar, while Deiphobus pretended to embrace Achilles,
wounded him in the heel, and killed him on the spot, either because the
arrow was poisoned, or because he was wounded on the great tendon, which
has since been called ‘tendon Achillis,’ a&nbsp;spot where a wound might
very easily be mortal.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
This story of the death of Achilles does not seem to have been known to
Homer; for he appears, in the twenty-fourth book of the Odyssey, to
insinuate that that hero died in battle, fighting for the Grecian
cause.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
After his death Achilles was honoured as a Demigod, and Strabo says that
he had a temple near the promontory of Sigæum. Pausanias and Pliny the
Elder make mention of an island in the Euxine Sea, where the memory of
Achilles was expressly honoured, from which circumstances it had the
name of Achillea.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">After</span> the death of Achilles, Ajax and
Ulysses contend for his armour; the Greek chiefs having adjudged it to
the last, Ajax kills himself in despair, and his blood is changed into a
flower. When Ulysses has brought Philoctetes, who is possessed of the
arrows of Hercules, to the siege, and the destinies of Troy are thereby
accomplished, the city is taken and sacked, and Hecuba becomes the slave
of Ulysses.</p>

<p>The chiefs were seated; and a ring of the common people standing
<i>around</i>, Ajax, the lord of the seven-fold shield, arose before
them. And as he was impatient in his wrath, with stern features he
looked back upon the Sigæan shores, and the fleet upon the shore, and,
stretching out his hands, he said, “We are pleading,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13_1" id = "tag13_1" href = "#note13_1">1</a> O&nbsp;Jupiter,
our cause before the ships, and Ulysses vies with me! But he did not
hesitate to yield to the flames of Hector, which I withstood, <i>and</i>
which I drove from this fleet. It is safer, therefore, for him to
contend with artful words than with his <i>right</i> hand. But neither
does my talent lie in speaking, nor his<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_2"
id = "tag13_2" href = "#note13_2">2</a> in acting; and as great ability
as I have in fierce warfare, so much has he in talking. Nor do I think,
O&nbsp;Pelasgians, that my deeds need be related to you; for you have
been eye-witnesses of them. Let Ulysses recount his, which he has
performed without any witness, <i>and</i> of which night alone<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_3" id = "tag13_3" href = "#note13_3">3</a> is
conscious. I&nbsp;own that the prize that is sought is great; but the
rival of Ajax lessens its value. It is no proud thing, great though it
may be, to possess any thing
<span class = "pagenum">440</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 18-38.</span>
which Ulysses has hoped for. Already has he obtained the reward of this
contest, in which, when he shall have been worsted, he will be said to
have contended with me. And I, if my prowess were to be questioned,
should prevail by the nobleness of my birth, being the son of Telamon,
who took the city<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_4" id = "tag13_4" href =
"#note13_4">4</a> of Troy under the valiant Hercules, and entered the
Colchian shores in the Pagasæan ship. Æacus was his father, who there
gives laws to the silent <i>shades</i>, where the heavy stone urges
<i>downward</i> Sisyphus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_5" id =

<p>“The supreme Jupiter owns Æacus, and confesses that he is his
offspring. Thus Ajax is the third<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_6" id =
"tag13_6" href = "#note13_6">6</a> from Jupiter. And yet, O&nbsp;Greeks,

"tag13_7" id = "tag13_7" href = "#note13_7">7</a> I&nbsp;ask for what
belonged to my cousin? Why does one descended from the blood of
Sisyphus, and very like him in thefts and fraud, intrude the name of a
strange family among the descendants of Æacus? Are the arms to be denied
me, because I took up arms before <i>him</i>, and through the means of
no informer?<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_8" id = "tag13_8" href =
"#note13_8">8</a> and shall one seem preferable who was the last to take

discovered the contrivance<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_10" id =

<span class = "pagenum">441</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 38-61.</span>
cowardly mind, and dragged him forth to the arms which he had avoided.
Now let him take the best arms who would have taken none. Let me be
dishonoured, and stripped of the gifts that belonged to my cousin, who
presented myself in the front of danger. And I could wish that that
madness had been either real or believed <i>so to be</i>, and that he
had never attended us as a companion to the Phrygian towers, this
counsellor of evil! Then, son of Pœas,<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_11"
id = "tag13_11" href = "#note13_11">11</a> Lemnos would not have had
thee exposed <i>there</i> through our guilt; who now, as they say,
concealed in sylvan caves, art moving the <i>very</i> rocks with thy
groans, and art wishing for the son of Laërtes what he has deserved;
which, may the Gods, the Gods, <i>I&nbsp;say</i>, grant thee not to pray
in vain.</p>

<p>“And now, he that was sworn upon the same arms with ourselves, one of
our leaders, alas! by whom, as his successor, the arrows of Hercules are
used, broken by disease and famine, is being clothed<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13_12" id = "tag13_12" href = "#note13_12">12</a> and fed by
birds; and in shooting fowls, he is employing the shafts destined for
the destruction of Troy. Still, he lives, because he did not accompany
Ulysses. And the unhappy Palamedes would have preferred that he had been
left behind; <i>then</i> he would have been living, or, at least, he
would have had a death without any criminality. Him, <i>Ulysses</i>
remembering too well the unlucky discovery of his madness, pretended to
be betraying the Grecian interests, and proved his feigned charge, and
shewed <i>the Greeks</i> the gold, which he had previously hidden in the
ground. By exile then, or by death,<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_13" id
= "tag13_13" href = "#note13_13">13</a> has he withdrawn from the Greeks
their
<span class = "pagenum">442</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 61-89.</span>
<i>best</i> strength. Thus Ulysses fights, thus is he to be dreaded.
Though he were to excel even the faithful Nestor in eloquence, yet he
would never cause me to believe that the forsaking of Nestor<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_14" id = "tag13_14" href = "#note13_14">14</a> was
not a crime; who, when he implored <i>the aid of</i> Ulysses, retarded
by the wound of his steed, and wearied with the years of old age, was
deserted by his companion. The son of Tydeus knows full well that these
charges are not invented by me, who calling on him often by name,
rebuked him, and upbraided<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_15" id =
"tag13_15" href = "#note13_15">15</a> his trembling friend with his
flight. The Gods above behold the affairs of men with just eyes. Lo! he
wants help, himself, who gave it not; and as he left <i>another</i>, so
was he doomed to be left: <i>such</i> law had he made for himself.</p>

<p>“He called aloud to his companions. I came, and I saw him trembling,
and pale with fear, and shuddering at the impending death.
I&nbsp;opposed the mass of my shield <i>to the enemy</i>, and covered
him<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_16" id = "tag13_16" href =
"#note13_16">16</a> as he lay; and I preserved (and that is the least
part of my praise) his dastardly life. If thou dost persist in vying,
let us return to that place; restore the enemy, and thy wound, and thy
wonted fear; and hide behind my shield, and under that contend with me.
But, after I delivered him, he to whom his wounds <i>before</i> gave no
strength for standing, fled, retarded by no wound <i>whatever</i>.
Hector approaches, and brings the Gods along with him to battle, and
where he rushes on, not only art thou alarmed, Ulysses, but even the
valiant <i>are</i>; so great terror does he bring. Him, as he exulted in
the successes of his bloodstained slaughter, in close conflict,
I&nbsp;laid flat with a huge stone. Him demanding one with whom he might
engage, did I alone withstand; and you, Greeks, prayed <i>it might
fall</i> to my lot;<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_17" id = "tag13_17"
href = "#note13_17">17</a> and your prayers prevailed.
<span class = "pagenum">443</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 89-116.</span>
If you inquire into the issue of this fight, I&nbsp;was not beaten by
him.</p>

<p>“Lo! the Trojans bring fire and sword, and Jove, <i>as well</i>,
against the Grecian fleet. Where is now the eloquent Ulysses? I,
forsooth, protected a thousand ships, the hopes of your return, with my
breast. Grant me the arms, in return for so many ships. But, if I may be
allowed to speak the truth, a&nbsp;greater honour is sought for them
than is for me, and our glory is united; and Ajax is sought for the
arms, and not the arms by Ajax. Let the Ithacan <i>Ulysses</i> compare
with these things Rhesus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_18" id =
"tag13_18" href = "#note13_18">18</a> and the unwarlike Dolon,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_19" id = "tag13_19" href = "#note13_19">19</a> and
Helenus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_20" id = "tag13_20" href =
"#note13_20">20</a> the son of Priam, made captive with the ravished
Pallas. By daylight nothing was done; nothing when Diomedes was afar. If
once you give these arms for services so mean, divide them, and that of
Diomedes would be the greater share of them. But, why these for the
Ithacan? who, by stealth and unarmed, ever does his work, and deceives
the unwary enemy by stratagem? The very brilliancy of his helmet, as it
sparkles with bright gold, will betray his plans, and discover him as he
lies hid. But neither will the Dulichian<a class = "tag" name =
"tag13_21" id = "tag13_21" href = "#note13_21">21</a> head, beneath the
helm of Achilles, sustain a weight so great; and the spear<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_22" id = "tag13_22" href = "#note13_22">22</a> from
Pelion must be heavy and burdensome for unwarlike arms. Nor will the
shield, embossed with the form of the great globe, beseem a dastard left
hand, and one formed for theft. Why <i>then</i>, caitiff, dost thou ask
for a gift that will <i>but</i> weaken thee? should the mistake of the
Grecian people bestow it on thee, there would be a cause for thee to be
stripped, not for thee to be dreaded by the enemy. Thy flight, too, (in
which, alone, most dastardly <i>wretch</i>! thou dost excel all
<i>others</i>,) will be retarded, when dragging a load so
<span class = "pagenum">444</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 116-146.</span>
great. Besides, that shield of thine, which has so rarely experienced
the conflict, is unhurt; for mine, which is gaping in a thousand wounds
from bearing the darts, a&nbsp;new successor must be obtained. In fine,
what need is there for words? Let us be tried in action. Let the arms of
that brave hero be thrown in the midst of the enemy: order them to be
fetched thence, and adorn him that brings them back, with them so
brought off.”</p>

<p>The son of Telamon had <i>now</i> ended, and a murmur among the
multitude ensued upon his closing words, until the Laërtian hero stood
up, and fixing his eyes, for a short time, on the ground, raised them
towards the chiefs, and opened his mouth in the accents that were looked
for; nor was gracefulness wanting to his eloquent words.</p>

<p>“If my prayers had been of any avail together with yours, Pelasgians,
the successor to a prize so great would not <i>now</i> be in question,
and thou wouldst now be enjoying thine arms, and we thee,
O&nbsp;Achilles. But since the unjust Fates have denied him to me and to
yourselves, (and here he wiped his eyes with his hands as though
shedding tears,) who could better <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘succed’">succeed</ins> the great Achilles than he through
whom<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_23" id = "tag13_23" href =
"#note13_23">23</a> the great Achilles joined the Greeks? Only let it
not avail him that he seems to be as stupid as he <i>really</i> is; and
let not my talents, which ever served you, O&nbsp;Greeks, be a prejudice
to me: and let this eloquence of mine, if there is any, which now pleads
for its possessor, and has often <i>done so</i> for yourselves, stand
clear of envy, and let each man not disown his own advantages. For <i>as
to</i> descent and ancestors, and the things which we have not made
ourselves, I&nbsp;scarce call these our own. But, indeed, since Ajax
boasts that he is the great grandson of Jove, Jupiter, too, is the
founder of my family, and by just as many degrees am I distant from him.
For Laërtes is my father, Arcesius his, Jupiter his; nor was any one of
these <i>ever</i> condemned<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_24" id =
"tag13_24" href = "#note13_24">24</a> and banished. Through the
mother,<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_25" id = "tag13_25" href =
"#note13_25">25</a> too,
<span class = "pagenum">445</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 146-167.</span>
Cyllenian <i>Mercury</i>, another noble stock, is added to myself. On
the side of either parent there was a God. But neither because I am more
nobly born on my mother’s side, nor because my father is innocent of his
brother’s blood, do I claim the arms <i>now</i> in question. By
<i>personal</i> merit weigh the cause. So that it be no merit in Ajax
that Telamon and Peleus were brothers; and <i>so that</i> not
consanguinity, but the honour of merit, be regarded in <i>the disposal
of</i> these spoils. Or if nearness of relationship and the next heir is
sought, Peleus is his sire, and Pyrrhus is his son. What room,
<i>then</i>, is there for Ajax? Let them be taken to Phthia<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_26" id = "tag13_26" href = "#note13_26">26</a> or to
Scyros. Nor is Teucer<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_27" id = "tag13_27"
href = "#note13_27">27</a> any less a cousin of Achilles than he; and
yet does he sue for, does he expect to bear away the arms?</p>

<p>“Since then the contest is simply one of deeds; I, in truth, have
done more than what it is easy for me to comprise in words. Yet I shall
proceed in the order of events. <i>Thetis</i>, the Nereid mother,
prescient of coming death, conceals her son by his dress. The disguise
of the assumed dress deceived all, among whom was Ajax. Amid woman’s
trinkets I mixed arms such as would affect the mind of a man. And not
yet had the hero thrown aside the dress of a maiden, when, as he was
brandishing a shield and a spear, I&nbsp;said, ‘O son of a Goddess,
Pergamus reserves itself to fall through thee. Why, <i>then</i>, dost
thou delay to overthrow the mighty Troy?’ And <i>then</i> I laid my
hands on him, and to brave deeds I sent forth the brave. His deeds then
are my own. ’Twas I that subdued Telephus, as he fought with his lance;
’twas I that recovered him, vanquished, and begging <i>for his life</i>.
That Thebes has fallen, is my doing. Believe me, that I took Lesbos,
that I <i>took</i> Tenedos, Chrysa<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_28" id
= "tag13_28" href = "#note13_28">28</a> and Cylla, cities of Apollo, and
Scyros <i>too</i>. Consider too, that the Lyrnessian<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13_29" id = "tag13_29" href = "#note13_29">29</a>
<span class = "pagenum">446</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 176-208.</span>
walls were levelled with the ground, shaken by my right hand. And, not
to mention other things, ’twas I, in fact, that found one who might slay
the fierce Hector; through me the renowned Hector lies prostrate. By
those arms through which Achilles was found out, I&nbsp;demand these
arms. To him when living I gave them; after his death I ask them back
again.</p>

<p>“After the grief of one<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_30" id =
"tag13_30" href = "#note13_30">30</a> had reached all the Greeks, and a
thousand ships had filled the Eubœan Aulis, the breezes long expected
were either not existing or adverse to the fleet; and the ruthless
oracles commanded Agamemnon to slay his innocent daughter for the cruel
Diana. This the father refuses, and is enraged against the Gods
themselves, and, a&nbsp;king, he is still a father. By my words I swayed
the gentle disposition of the parent to the public advantage. Now,
indeed, I&nbsp;make this confession, and let the son of Atreus forgive
me as I confess it; before a partial judge I upheld a difficult cause.
Yet the good of the people and his brother, and the supreme power of the
sceptre granted to him, influence him to balance praise against blood.
I&nbsp;was sent, too, to the mother, who was not to be persuaded, but to
be deceived with craft; to whom, if the son of Telamon had gone, until
even now would our sails have been without wind. A&nbsp;bold envoy, too,
I&nbsp;was sent to the towers of Ilium, and the senate-house of lofty
Troy was seen and entered by me; and still was it filled with their
heroes. Undaunted, I&nbsp;pleaded the cause which all Greece had
entrusted to me; and I accused Paris, and I demanded back the plunder,
and Helen <i>as well</i>; and I moved Priam and Antenor<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13_31" id = "tag13_31" href = "#note13_31">31</a>, related to
Priam. But Paris and his brothers, and those who, under him, had been
ravishers, scarce withheld their wicked hands; <i>and</i> this thou
knowest, Menelaüs, and that was the first day of my danger in company
with thee. It were a tedious matter to relate the things which, by my
counsel and my valour, I&nbsp;have successfully executed in the duration
of this tedious warfare.</p>

<p>“After the first encounter, the enemy for a long time kept themselves
within the walls of the city, and there was
<span class = "pagenum">447</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 209-237.</span>
no opportunity for open fight. At length, in the tenth year we fought.
<i>And</i> what wast thou doing in the mean time, thou, who knowest of
nothing but battles? what was the use of thee? But if thou inquirest
into my actions: I&nbsp;lay ambuscades for the enemy; I&nbsp;surround
the trenches<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_32" id = "tag13_32" href =
"#note13_32">32</a> with redoubts; I&nbsp;cheer our allies that they may
bear with patient minds the tediousness of a protracted war;
I&nbsp;show, <i>too</i>, how we are to be supported, and how to be
armed; I&nbsp;am sent<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_33" id = "tag13_33"
href = "#note13_33">33</a> whither necessity requires. Lo! by the advice
of Jove, the king, deceived by a form in his sleep, commands him to
dismiss all care of the war <i>thus</i> begun. He is enabled, through
the author of it, to defend his own cause. Ajax should not have allowed
this, and should have demanded that Troy be razed. And he should have
fought, the <i>only</i> thing he could do. Why, does he not stop them
when about to depart? Why does he not take up arms, and <i>why not</i>
suggest some course for the fickle multitude to pursue? This was not too
much for him, who never says any thing but what is grand. Well, and
didst thou take to flight? I&nbsp;was witness of it, and ashamed I was
to see, when thou wast turning thy back, and wast preparing the sails of
disgrace. Without delay, I&nbsp;exclaimed, ‘What are you doing? What
madness made you, O&nbsp;my friends, quit Troy, <i>well nigh</i> taken?
And what, in this tenth year, are you carrying home but disgrace?’</p>

<p>“With these and other <i>words</i>, for which grief itself had made
me eloquent, I&nbsp;brought back the resisting <i>Greeks</i> from the
flying fleet. The son of Atreus calls together his allies, struck with
terror; nor, even yet, does the son of Telamon dare to utter a word; yet
Thersites<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_34" id = "tag13_34" href =
"#note13_34">34</a> dares to launch out against the kings with impudent
remarks, although not unpunished by myself. I&nbsp;am aroused, and I
incite the trembling citizens against the foe, and by my voice I reclaim
their lost courage. From that time, whatever that man, whom I drew away
as he
<span class = "pagenum">448</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 237-266.</span>
was turning his back, may seem to have done bravely, is <i>all</i> my
own. In fine, who of the Greeks is either praising thee, or resorts to
thee; but with me the son of Tydeus shares his exploits; he praises me,
and is ever confident while Ulysses is his companion. It is something,
out of so many thousands of the Greeks, to be singled out alone by
Diomedes. Nor was it lot that ordered me to go forth; and yet, despising
the dangers of the night and of the enemy, I&nbsp;slew Dolon, <i>one</i>
of the Phrygian race, who dared the same things that we <i>dared</i>;
though not before I had compelled him<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_35"
id = "tag13_35" href = "#note13_35">35</a> to disclose everything, and
had learned what perfidious Troy designed. Everything had I <i>now</i>
discovered, and I had nothing <i>further</i> to find out, and I might
now have returned, with my praises going before me. Not content with
that, I&nbsp;sought the tent of Rhesus, and in his own camp slew himself
and his attendants. And thus, as a conqueror, and having gained my own
desires, I&nbsp;returned in the captured chariot, resembling a joyous
triumph. Deny me the arms of him whose horses the enemy had demanded as
the price for <i>one</i> night’s service; and let Ajax be
<i>esteemed</i> your greater benefactor.</p>

<p>“Why should I make reference to the troops of Lycian Sarpedon,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag13_36" id = "tag13_36" href =
"#note13_36">36</a> mowed down by my sword? With much bloodshed I slew
Cœranos, the son of Iphitus, and Alastor, and Chromius, and Alcander,
and Halius, and Noëmon, and Prytanis, and I put to death Thoön, with
Chersidamas, and Charops, and Ennomos, impelled by his relentless fate;
five of less renown fell by my hand beneath the city walls. I, too,
fellow-citizens, have wounds, honourable in their place.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13_37" id = "tag13_37" href = "#note13_37">37</a> Believe not
<i>his</i> crafty words; here! behold them.” And <i>then</i>, with his
hand, he pulls aside his garment, and, “this is the breast,” says he,
“that has been ever employed in your service.”</p>

<p>“But the son of Telamon has spent none of his blood on his friends
for so many years, and he has a body without a
<span class = "pagenum">449</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 266-299.</span>
<i>single</i> wound.<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_38" id = "tag13_38"
href = "#note13_38">38</a> But what signifies that, if he says that he
bore arms for the Pelasgian fleet against both the Trojans and Jupiter
himself? I&nbsp;confess it, he did bear them; nor is it any part of mine
with malice to detract from the good deeds <i>of others;</i> but let him
not alone lay claim to what belongs to all, and let him give to
yourselves, as well, some of the honour. The descendant of Actor, safe
under the appearance of Achilles, repelled the Trojans, with their
defender, from the ships on the point of being burnt. He, too, unmindful
of the king, and of the chiefs, and of myself, fancies that he alone
dared to engage<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_39" id = "tag13_39" href =
"#note13_39">39</a> with Hector in combat, being the ninth in that duty,
and preferred by favour of the lot. But yet, most brave <i>chief</i>,
what was the issue of thy combat? Hector came off, injured by no wound.
Ah, wretched me! with how much grief am I compelled to recollect that
time at which Achilles, the bulwark of the Greeks, was slain: nor tears,
nor grief, nor fear, hindered me from carrying his body aloft from the
ground; on these shoulders, I&nbsp;say, on these shoulders I bore the
body of Achilles, and his arms together <i>with him</i>, which now, too,
I&nbsp;am endeavouring to bear off. I&nbsp;have strength to suffice for
such a weight, <i>and</i>, assuredly, I&nbsp;have a soul that will be
sensible of your honours.</p>

<p>“Was then, forsooth! his azure mother <i>so</i> anxious in her son’s
behalf that the heavenly gifts, a&nbsp;work of so great ingenuity,
a&nbsp;rough soldier, and one without any genius, should put on? For he
will not understand the engravings on the shield; the ocean, and the
earth, and the stars with the lofty heavens and the Pleïades, and the
Hyades, and the Bear that avoids the sea, and the different cities, and
the blazing sword of Orion; arms he insists on receiving, which he does
not understand. What! and does he charge that I, avoiding the duties of
this laborious war, came but late to the toil begun? and does he not
perceive that <i>in this</i> he is defaming the brave Achilles? If he
calls dissembling a crime, we have both of us dissembled.
<span class = "pagenum">450</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 299-336.</span>
If delay <i>stands</i> for a fault, I&nbsp;was earlier than he.
A&nbsp;fond wife detained me, a&nbsp;fond mother Achilles. The first
part of our time was given to them, the rest to yourselves. I&nbsp;am
not alarmed, if now I am unable to defend myself against this
accusation, in common with so great a man. Yet he was found out by the
dexterity of Ulysses, but not Ulysses <i>by that</i> of Ajax.</p>

<p>“And that we may not be surprised at his pouring out on me the
reproaches of his silly tongue, against you, too, does he make
objections worthy of shame. Is it base for me, with a false crime to
have charged Palamedes, <i>and</i> honourable for you to have condemned
him? But neither could <i>Palamedes</i>, the son of Nauplius, defend a
crime so great, and so manifest; nor did you <i>only</i> hear the
charges against him, <i>but</i> you witnessed them, and in the bribe
<i>itself</i> the charge was established. Nor have I deserved to be
accused, because Lemnos, <i>the isle</i> of Vulcan, <i>still</i>
receives <i>Philoctetes</i>, the son of Pœas. <i>Greeks</i>, defend your
own acts! for you consented to it. Nor yet shall I deny that I advised
him to withdraw himself from the toils of the warfare and the voyage,
and to try by rest to assuage his cruel pains. He consented, and
<i>still</i> he lives. This advice was not only well-meant, but <i>it
was</i> fortunate as well, when ’twas enough to be well-meant. Since our
prophets demand him for the purpose of destroying Troy, entrust not that
to me. The son of Telamon will be better to go, and by his eloquence
will soften the hero, maddened by diseases and anger, or by some wile
will skilfully bring him thence. Sooner will Simoïs flow backward, and
Ida stand without foliage, and Achaia promise aid to Troy, than, my
breast being inactive in your interest, the skill of stupid Ajax shall
avail the Greeks.</p>

<p>“Though thou be, relentless Philoctetes, enraged against thy friends
and the king, and myself, though thou curse and devote my head,
everlastingly, and though thou wish to have me in thy anguish thrown in
thy way perchance, and to shed my blood; and though if I meet thee, so
thou wilt have the opportunity of meeting me, still will I attempt
<i>thee, and</i> will endeavour to bring thee back with me. And, if
Fortune favours me, I&nbsp;will as surely be the possessor of thy
arrows, as I was the possessor of the Dardanian prophet<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13_40" id = "tag13_40" href = "#note13_40">40</a> whom I took
<i>prisoner; and so</i> I revealed the answers of the Deities and the
fates of Troy;
<span class = "pagenum">451</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 337-362.</span>
<i>and</i> as I carried off the hidden statue<a class = "tag" name =
"tag13_41" id = "tag13_41" href = "#note13_41">41</a> of the Phrygian
Minerva from the midst of the enemy. And does Ajax, <i>then</i>, compare
himself with me? The Fates, in fact, would not allow Troy to be captured
without that <i>statue</i>. Where is the valiant Ajax? where are the
boastful words of that mighty man? Why art thou trembling here? Why
dares Ulysses to go through the guards, and to entrust himself to the
night, and, through fell swords, to enter not only the walls of Troy,
but even its highest towers, and to tear the Goddess from her shrine,
and, <i>thus</i> torn, to bear her off amid the enemy?</p>

<p>“Had I not done these things, in vain would the son of Telamon been
bearing the seven hides of the bulls on his left arm. On that night was
the victory over Troy gained by me; then did I conquer Pergamus, when I
rendered it capable of being conquered. Forbear by thy looks,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_42" id = "tag13_42" href = "#note13_42">42</a> and
thy muttering, to show me the son of Tydeus; a&nbsp;part of the glory in
these things is his own. Neither wast thou alone, when for the allied
fleet thou didst grasp thy shield: a&nbsp;multitude was attending thee,
<i>while</i> but one fell to me: who, did he not know that a fighting
man is of less value than a wise one, and that the reward is not the due
of the invincible right hand, would himself, too, have been suing for
these <i>arms</i>; the more discreet Ajax would have been suing, and the
fierce Eurypilus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_43" id = "tag13_43" href

same land, and the brother of the greater son of Atreus have sought
them. But these, brave in action, (nor are they second to thee in war,)
have <i>all</i> yielded to my wisdom. Thy right hand is of value in war,
<span class = "pagenum">452</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 362-397.</span>
<i>but</i> thy temper is one that stands in need of my direction. Thou
hast strength without intelligence; I&nbsp;have a care for the future.
Thou art able to fight; with me, the son of Atreus chooses the
<i>proper</i> time for fighting. Thou only art of service with thy body;
I&nbsp;with my mind: and as much as he who guides the bark, is superior
to the capacity of the rower, as much as the general is greater than the
soldier, so much do I excel thee; and in my body there is an intellect
that is superior to hands: in that <i>lies</i> all my vigour.</p>

<p>“But you, ye chieftains, give the reward to your watchful
<i>servant;</i> and for the cares of so many years which I have passed
in anxiety, grant this honour as a compensation for my services. Our
toil is now at its close; I&nbsp;have removed the opposing Fates, and by
rendering it capable of being taken, <i>in effect</i> I have taken the
lofty Pergamus. Now, by our common hopes, and the walls of the Trojans
doomed to fall, and by those Gods whom lately I took from the enemy, by
anything that remains, through wisdom to be done; if, too, anything
<i>remains</i> of bold enterprize, and to be recovered from a dangerous
spot; if you think that anything is still wanting for the downfall of
Troy; <i>then</i> remember me; or if you give not me the arms, concede
them to this;” and <i>then</i> he discovers the fatal statue of
Minerva.</p>

<p>The body of the chiefs is moved, and <i>then</i>, in fact appears
what eloquence can do; and the fluent man receives the arms of a brave
one. He, who so often has alone withstood both Hector, and the sword,
and flames, and Jove <i>himself</i>, cannot <i>now</i> withstand his
wrath alone, and grief conquers the man that is invincible. He seizes
his sword, and he says:&mdash; “This, at least, is my own; or will
Ulysses claim this, too, for himself. This must I use against myself;
and <i>the blade</i>, which has often been wet with the blood of the
Phrygians, will now be wet with the slaughter of its owner: that no one
but Ajax <i>himself</i>, may be enabled to conquer Ajax.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> he said; and he plunged the fatal sword into his breast,
then for the first time suffering a wound, where it lay exposed to the
steel. Nor were his hands able to draw out the weapon there fixed: the
blood itself forced it out. And the earth, made red by the blood,
produced a purple flower from the green turf, <i>the same</i> which had
formerly been produced from the Œbalian wound. Letters common to
<i>that</i> youth

"#note13_48">48</a> and of the illustrious Thoas, and the regions
infamous for the slaughter <i>there</i> of the husbands of old; that he
might bring back the arrows, the weapons of the Tirynthian <i>hero</i>.
After he had carried them back to the Greeks, their owner attending too,
the concluding hand was put, at length, to this protracted war. Troy and
Priam fell together; the wretched wife of Priam lost after every thing
<i>else</i> her human form, and alarmed a foreign air<a class = "tag"
name = "tag13_49" id = "tag13_49" href = "#note13_49">49</a> with her
barkings. Where the long Hellespont is reduced into a narrow compass,
Ilion was in flames; nor had the flames yet ceased; and the altar of
Jove had drank up the scanty blood of the aged Priam. The priestess of
Apollo<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_50" id = "tag13_50" href =
"#note13_50">50</a> dragged by the hair, extends her unavailing hands
towards the heavens. The victorious Greeks drag along the Dardanian
matrons, embracing, while they may, the statues of their country’s Gods,
and clinging to the burning temples, an envied spoil. Astyanax<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_51" id = "tag13_51" href = "#note13_51">51</a> is
hurled from those towers from which he was often wont, when shown by his
mother, to behold his father, fighting for himself, and defending the
kingdom of his ancestors.</p>

<p>And now Boreas bids them depart, and with a favourable breeze, the
sails, as they wave, resound, <i>and</i> the sailors bid them take
advantage of the winds. “Troy, farewell!” the Trojan women cry;&mdash;
“We are torn away!” and they give kisses to the soil, and leave the
smoking roofs of their country. The last that goes on board the fleet,
a&nbsp;dreadful sight, is Hecuba, found amid the sepulchres of her
children. Dulichian hands have dragged her away, while clinging to their
tombs and giving kisses to their bones; yet the ashes of one has she
taken out,
<span class = "pagenum">454</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 426-438.</span>
and, <i>so</i> taken out, has carried with her in her bosom the ashes of
Hector. On the tomb of Hector she leaves the grey hair of her head, an
humble offering, her hair and her tears. There is opposite to Phrygia,
where Troy stood, a&nbsp;land inhabited by the men of Bistonia. There,
was the rich palace of Polymnestor, to whom thy father, Polydorus,
entrusted thee, to be brought up privately, and removed thee <i>afar</i>
from the Phrygian arms. A&nbsp;wise resolution; had he not added, <i>as
well</i>, great riches, the reward of crime, the incentive of an
avaricious disposition. When the fortunes of the Phrygians were ruined,
the wicked king of the Phrygians took a sword, and plunged it in the
throat of his fosterchild; and, as though the crime could be removed
with the body, he hurled him lifeless from a rock into the waters
below.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
It may with justice be said, that in the speeches of Ajax Telamon, and
Ulysses, here given, the Poet has presented us with a masterpiece of
genius; both in the lively colours in which he has described the two
rivals, and the ingenious manner in which he has throughout sustained
the contrast between their respective characters.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The ancient writers are not agreed upon the question, who was the mother
of Ajax Telamon; Dares says that it was Hesione; while Apollodorus,
Plutarch, Tzetzes and others, allege that it was Peribœa, the daughter
of Alcathoüs, the son of Pelops. Pindar and Apollodorus say, that
Hercules, on going to visit his friend Telamon, prayed to Jupiter that
Telamon might have a son, whose skin should be as impenetrable as that
of the Nemæan lion, which he then wore. As he prayed, he espied an
eagle; upon which, he informed his friend that a favourable event
awaited his prayer, and desired him to call his son after the name of an
eagle, which in the Greek is <span class = "greek" title =
"aietos">αἰετὸς</span>. The Scholiast on Sophocles, Suidas and Tzetzes,
say further, that when Hercules returned to see Telamon, after the birth
of Ajax, he covered him with the lion’s skin, and that by this means
Ajax became invulnerable except in that spot of his body, which was
beneath the hole which the arrow of Hercules had made in the skin of the
beast.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Dictys, Suidas, and Cedrenus affirm, that the dispute of Ulysses and
Ajax Telamon was about the Palladium, to which each of them laid claim.
They add, that the Grecian nobles, having adjudged it to Ulysses, Ajax
threatened to slay them, and was found dead in his tent the next
morning; but it is more generally stated to the effect here related by
Ovid, that he killed himself, because he could not obtain the armour of
Achilles. Filled with grief and anger combined, he became distracted;
and after falling on some flocks, which in his madness he took for
enemies, he at last stabbed himself with the sword which he had received
from Hector. This account has been followed by Euripides, in his tragedy
on the subject of the death of Ajax; and Homer seems to allude to this
story, when he makes Ulysses say, that on his descent to the Infernal
Regions, the shades of all
<span class = "pagenum">455</span>
the Grecian heroes immediately met him, except that of Ajax, whose
resentment at their former dispute about the armour of Achilles was
still so warm, that he would not come near him. The Scholiast on Homer,
and Eustathius, say that Agamemnon being much embarrassed how to behave
in a dispute which might have proved fatal to the Grecian cause, ordered
the Trojan prisoners to come before the council to give their opinion,
as to which of them had done the most mischief; and that they answered
in favour of Ulysses. The Scholiast on Aristophanes also adds, that
Agamemnon, not satisfied with this enquiry, sent out spies to know what
was the opinion of the Trojans on the relative merits of Ulysses and
Ajax; and that upon their report, he decided in favour of Ulysses.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
According to Pliny and Pausanias, Ajax was buried near the promontory of
Sigæum, where a tomb was erected for him; though other writers, on the
authority of Dictys, place his tomb on the promontory of Rhœtæum. Horace
speaks of him as being denied the honour of a funeral; but he evidently
alludes to a passage in the tragedy of Sophocles, where the poet
introduces Agamemnon as obstinately refusing to allow him burial, till
he is softened by the entreaties of Teucer.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is probable that Homer knew nothing of the story here mentioned
relative to the concealment of Achilles, disguised in female apparel, by
Thetis, in the court of Lycomedes, her brother; for speaking of the
manner in which Achilles engaged in the war, he says that Nestor and
Ulysses went to visit Peleus and Menœtius, and easily prevailed with
them that Achilles and Patroclus should accompany them to the war. It
was, however, at the court of Lycomedes that Achilles fell in love with
and married Deidamia, by whom he had Pyrrhus, or Neoptolemus, who was
present at the taking of Troy, at a very early age.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Polydorus is related in the third Book of the Æneid, and is
also told by Hyginus, with some variations. He says that Polydorus was
sent by Priam to Polymnestor, king of Thrace, while he was yet in his
cradle; and that Ilione, the daughter of Priam, distrusting the cruelty
and avarice of Polymnestor, who was her husband, educated the child as
her own son, and made their own son Deiphylus pass for Polydorus, the
two infants being of the same age. He also says that the Greeks, after
the taking of Troy, offered Electra to Polymnestor in marriage, on
condition that he should divorce Ilione, and slay Polydorus, and that
Polymnestor, having acceded to their proposal, unconsciously killed his
own son Deiphylus. Polydorus going to consult the oracle concerning his
future fortune, was told, that his father was dead, and his native city
reduced to ashes; on which he imagined that the oracle had deceived him;
but returning to Thrace, his sister informed him of the secret, on which
he deprived Polymnestor of his sight<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

which to bathe the body of her daughter, she espies the corpse of her
son Polydorus. In her exasperations

honoured with a magnificent funeral, and, at the prayer of Aurora, his
ashes are transformed by Jupiter into birds, since called
Memnonides.</p>

<p>On the Thracian shore the son of Atreus had moored his fleet, until
the sea was calm, <i>and</i> until the wind was more propitious. Here,
on a sudden, Achilles, as great as he was wont to be when alive, rises
from the ground, bursting far and wide, and, like to one threatening,
revives the countenance of that time when he fiercely attacked Agamemnon
with his lawless sword. “And are you departing, unmindful of me, ye
Greeks?” he says; “and is all grateful remembrance of my valour buried
together with me? Do not so. And that my sepulchre may not be without
honour, let Polyxena slain appease the ghost of Achilles.” <i>Thus</i>
he said; and his companions obeying the implacable shade, the noble and
unfortunate maid, and more than <i>an ordinary</i> woman, torn from the
bosom of her mother, which she now cherished almost alone, was led to
the tomb, and became a sacrifice at his ruthless pile.</p>

<p>She, mindful of herself, after she was brought to the cruel altar,
and had perceived that the savage rites were preparing for her; and when

my body unconsumed to my mother, and let her not purchase for me with
gold, but with tears, the sad privilege of a sepulchre. When <i>in
former times</i> she could, then used she to purchase with gold.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> she said; but the people did not restrain those tears
which she restrained. Even the priest himself, weeping and reluctant,
divided her presented breast with the piercing steel. She, sinking to
the earth on her failing knees, maintained an undaunted countenance to
the last moment of her life. Even then was it her care, when she fell,
to cover the features that ought to be concealed, and to preserve the
honour of her chaste modesty. The Trojan matrons received her, and
reckoned the children of Priam whom they had had to deplore; and how
much blood one house had expended. And they lament thee, Oh virgin! and
thee, Oh thou! so lately called a royal wife <i>and</i> a royal mother,
<i>once</i> the resemblance of flourishing Asia, but now a worthless
prey amid the plunder <i>of Troy</i>; which the conquering Ulysses would
have declined as his, but that thou hadst brought Hector forth.
<i>And</i> scarce did Hector find an owner for his mother. She,
embracing the body bereft of a soul so brave, gave to that as well,
those tears which so oft she had given for her country, her children,
and her husband; <i>and</i> her tears she poured in his wounds. And she
impressed kisses with her lips, and beat her breast <i>now</i>
accustomed to it; and trailing her grey hairs in the clotted blood, many
things indeed did she say, but these as well, as she tore her
breast:</p>

<p>“My daughter, the last affliction (for what now remains?) to thy
mother: my daughter, thou liest prostrate, and I behold thy wound
<i>as</i> my own wounds. Lo! lest I should have lost any one of my
children without bloodshed, thou, too, dost receive thy wound. Still,
because <i>thou wast</i> a woman, I&nbsp;supposed thee safe from the
sword; and <i>yet</i>, a&nbsp;woman, thou hast fallen by the sword. The
same Achilles, the ruin of Troy, and the bereaver of myself, the same
has destroyed thus many of thy brothers, <i>and</i> thyself. But, after
he had fallen by the arrows of Paris and of Phœbus, ‘Now, at least,’
I&nbsp;said, ‘Achilles is no <i>longer</i> to be dreaded;’ and yet even
now, was he to be dreaded by me. The very ashes of him, as he lies
buried, rage against this family; and <i>even</i> in the tomb have we
found him an enemy. For the descendant of Æacus have I been <i>thus</i>
prolific.

Great Ilion lies prostrate, and the public calamity is completed by a
dreadful catastrophe; if indeed, it is completed. Pergamus alone remains
for me: and my sorrow is still in its career. So lately the greatest
woman in the world, powerful in so many sons-in-law, and children<a
class = "tag" name = "tag13_53" id = "tag13_53" href =
"#note13_53">53</a>, and daughters-in-law, and in my husband, now I am
dragged into exile, destitute, <i>and</i> torn away from the tombs of my
kindred, as a present to Penelope. She, pointing me out to the matrons
of Ithaca, as I tease my allotted task, will say, ‘This is that famous
mother of Hector; this is the wife of Priam.’ And, now thou, who after
the loss of so many <i>children</i>, alone didst alleviate the sorrows
of thy mother, hast made the atonement at the tomb of the enemy. Atoning
sacrifices for an enemy have I brought forth. For what purpose, lasting
like iron, am I reserved? and why do I linger <i>here</i>? To what end
dost thou, pernicious age, detain me? Why, ye cruel Deities, unless to
the end that I may see fresh deaths, do ye reprieve an aged woman of
years so prolonged? Who could have supposed, that after the fall of
Troy, Priam could have been pronounced happy? Blessed in his death, he
has not beheld thee, my daughter, <i>thus</i> cut off; and at the same
moment, he lost his life and his kingdom.</p>

<p>“But, I&nbsp;suppose, thou, a maiden of royal birth, wilt be honoured
with funeral rites, and thy body will be deposited in the tombs of thy
ancestors. This is not the fortune of thy house; tears and a handful of
foreign sand will be thy lot, the <i>only</i> gifts of a mother. We have
lost all; a&nbsp;child most dear to his mother, now alone remains as a
reason for me to endure to live yet for a short time, once the youngest
of <i>all</i> my male issue, Polydorus, entrusted on these coasts to the
Ismarian king. Why, in the mean time, am I delaying to bathe her cruel
wounds with the stream, her features, too, besmeared with dreadful
blood?”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> she spoke; and with aged step she proceeded towards the
shore, tearing her grey locks. “Give me an urn, ye Trojan women,” the
unhappy <i>mother</i> had just said, in order that she might take up the
flowing waters, <i>when</i> she beheld<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_54"

<span class = "pagenum">459</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 536-571.</span>
the body of Polydorus thrown up on the shore, and the great wounds made
by the Thracian weapons. The Trojan women cried out aloud; with grief
she was struck dumb; and very grief consumed both her voice and the
tears that arose within; and much resembling a hard rock she became
benumbed. And at one moment she fixed her eyes on the ground before her;
<i>and</i> sometimes she raised her haggard features towards the skies;
<i>and</i> now she viewed the features, now the wounds of her son, as he
lay; the wounds especially; and she armed and prepared herself for
vengeance by rage. Soon as she was inflamed by it, as though she
<i>still</i> remained a queen, she determined to be revenged, and was
wholly <i>employed</i> in <i>devising</i> a <i>fitting</i> form of
punishment. And as the lioness rages when bereft of her sucking whelp,
and having found the tracks of his feet, follows the enemy that she sees
not; so Hecuba, after she had mingled rage with mourning, not forgetful
of her spirit, <i>but</i> forgetful of her years, went to Polymnestor,
the contriver of this dreadful murder, and demanded an interview; for
that it was her wish to show him a concealed treasure left for him to
give to her son.</p>

<p>The Odrysian <i>king</i> believes her, and, inured to the love of
gain, comes to a secret spot. Then with soothing lips, he craftily says,
“Away with delays, Hecuba, <i>and</i> give the present to thy son; all
that thou givest, and what thou hast already given, I&nbsp;swear by the
Gods above, shall be his.” Sternly she eyes him as he speaks, and
falsely swears; and she boils with heaving rage; and so flies on him,
seized by a throng of the captive matrons, and thrusts her fingers into
his perfidious eyes; and of their sight she despoils his cheeks, and
plunges her hands <i>into the sockets</i>, (’tis rage that makes her
strong); and, defiled with his guilty blood, she tears not his eyes, for
they are not left, <i>but</i> the places for his eyes.</p>

<p>Provoked by the death of their king, the Thracian people begin to
attack the Trojan <i>matron</i> with the hurling of darts and of stones.
But she attacks the stones thrown at her with a hoarse noise, and with
bites; and attempting to speak, her mouth just ready for the words, she
barks aloud. The place <i>still</i> exists, and derives its name<a class
= "tag" name = "tag13_55" id = "tag13_55" href = "#note13_55">55</a>
from the circumstance; and long remembering her ancient misfortunes,
even then did
<span class = "pagenum">460</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 571-612.</span>
she howl dismally through the Sithonian plains. Her <i>sad</i> fortune
moved both her own Trojans, and her Pelasgian foes, and all the Gods as
well; so much so, that even the wife and sister of Jove herself denied
that Hecuba had deserved that fate.</p>

<p>Although she has favoured those same arms, there is not leisure for
Aurora to be moved by the calamities and the fall of Troy. A&nbsp;nearer
care and grief at home for her lost Memnon is afflicting her. Him his
rosy-coloured mother saw perish by the spear of Achilles on the Phrygian
plains. <i>This</i> she saw; and that colour with which the hours of the
morning grow ruddy, turned pale, and the æther lay hid in clouds. But
the parent could not endure to behold his limbs laid on the closing
flames. But with loose hair, just as she was, she disdained not to fall
down at the knees of great Jove, and to add these words to her tears:
“Inferior to all <i>the Goddesses</i> which the golden æther does
sustain, (for throughout all the world are my temples the fewest),
still, a&nbsp;Goddess, I&nbsp;am come; not that thou shouldst grant me
temples and days of sacrifice, and altars to be heated with fires. But
if thou considerest how much I, a&nbsp;female, perform for thee, at the
time when, with the early dawn, I&nbsp;keep the confines of the night,
thou wouldst think that some reward ought to be given to me. But that is
not my care, nor is such now the condition of Aurora such that she
should demand the honours deserved by her. Bereft of my Memnon am I
come; <i>of him</i> who, in vain, wielded valiant arms for his uncle,
and who in his early years (’twas thus ye willed it,) was slain by the
brave Achilles. Give him, I&nbsp;pray, supreme ruler of the Gods, some
honour, as a solace for his death, and ease the wounds of a mother.”</p>

<p>Jove nods his assent; when <i>suddenly</i> the lofty pile of Memnon
sinks with its towering fires, and volumes of black smoke darken the
<i>light of</i> day. Just as when the rivers exhale the rising fogs, and
the sun is not admitted below them. The black embers fly, and rolling
into one body, they thicken, and take a form, and assume heat and life
from the flames. Their own lightness gives them wings; and first, like
birds, <i>and</i> then real birds, they flutter with their wings. At
once innumerable sisters are fluttering, whose natal origin is the same.
And thrice do they go around the pile, and thrice does their clamour
rise in concert into the air. In the fourth flight they separate their
company. Then two fierce tribes
<span class = "pagenum">461</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiii. 612-622.</span>
wage war from opposite sides, and with their beaks and crooked claws
expend their rage, and weary their wings and opposing breasts; and down
their kindred bodies fall, a&nbsp;sacrifice to the entombed ashes, and
they remember that from a great man they have received their birth.
Their progenitor gives a name to these birds so suddenly formed, called
Memnonides after him; when the Sun has run through the twelve signs
<i>of the Zodiac</i>, they fight, doomed to perish in battle, in honour
of their parent.<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_56" id = "tag13_56" href

<p>To others, therefore, it seemed a sad thing, that the daughter of
Dymas was <i>now</i> barking; <i>but</i> Aurora was intent on her own
sorrows; and even now she sheds the tears of affection, and sprinkles
them in dew over all the world.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The particulars which Ovid here gives of the misfortunes that befell the
family of Priam, with the exception of a few circumstances, agree
perfectly with the narratives of the ancient historians.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
According to Dictys, Philostratus, and Hyginus, after Achilles was slain
by the treachery of Paris, on the eve of his marriage with Polyxena, she
became inconsolable at his death, and returning to the Grecian camp, she
was kindly received by Agamemnon; but being unable to get the better of
her despair, she stole out of the camp at night, and stabbed herself at
the tomb of Achilles. Philostratus adds, that the ghost of Achilles
appeared to Apollonius Tyanæus, the hero of his story, and gave him
permission to ask him any questions he pleased, assuring him, that he
would give him full information on the subject of them. Among other
things, Apollonius desired to know if it was the truth that the Greeks
had sacrificed Polyxena on his tomb; to which the ghost replied, that
her grief made her take the resolution not to survive her intended
husband, and that she had killed herself.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Other writers, agreeing with Ovid as to the manner of her death, tell us
that it was Pyrrhus who sacrificed Polyxena to his father’s shade, to
revenge his death, of which, though innocently, she had been the cause.
Pausanias, who says that this was the general opinion, avers, on what
ground it is difficult to conceive, that Homer designedly omitted this
fact, because it was so dishonourable to the Greeks; and in his
description of the paintings at Delphi, by Polygnotus, of the
destruction of Troy, he says that Polyxena was there represented as
being led out to the tomb of Achilles, where she was sacrificed by the
Greeks. He also says, that he had seen her story painted in the same
manner at Pergamus, Athens, and other places. Many of the poets, and
Virgil in the number, affirm
<span class = "pagenum">462</span>
that Polyxena was sacrificed in Phrygia, near Troy, on the tomb of
Achilles, he having desired it at his death; while Euripides says that
it was in the Thracian Chersonesus, on a cenotaph, which was erected
there in honour of Achilles: and that his ghost appearing, Calchas was
consulted, who answered, that it was necessary to sacrifice Polyxena,
which was accordingly done by Pyrrhus.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The ancient writers are divided as to the descent of Hecuba. Homer, who
has been followed by his Scholiast, and by Ovid and Suidas, says that
she was the daughter of Dymas, King of Phrygia. Euripides says that she
was the daughter of Cisscus, and with him Virgil and Servius agree.
Apollodorus, again, makes her to be descended from Sangar and Merope. In
the distribution of spoil after the siege of Troy, Hecuba fell to the
share of Ulysses, and became his slave; but died soon after, in Thrace.
Plautus and Servius allege that the Greeks themselves circulated the
story of her transformation into a bitch, because she was perpetually
railing at them, to provoke them to put her to death, rather than
condemn her to pass her life as a slave. According to Strabo and
Pomponius Mela, in their time, the place of her burial was still to be
seen in Thrace. Euripides, in his Hecuba, has not followed this
tradition, but represents her as complaining that the Greeks had chained
her to the door of Agamemnon like a dog. Perhaps she became the slave of
Agamemnon after Ulysses had left the army, on his return to Ithaca; and
it is possible that the story of her transformation may have been solely
founded on this tradition. She bore to Priam ten sons and seven
daughters, and survived them all except Helenus; most of her sons having
fallen by the hand of Achilles.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Many ancient writers, with whom Ovid here agrees, affirm that Memnon was
the son of Tithonus, the brother of Priam, and Aurora, or Eos, the
Goddess of the morn. They also say that he came to assist the Trojans
with ten thousand Persians, and as many Æthiopians. Diodorus Siculus
asserts that Memnon was said to have been the son of Aurora, because he
left Phrygia, and went to settle in the East. It is not clear in what
country he fixed his residence. Some say that it was at Susa, in Persia;
others that it was in Egypt, or in Æthiopia, which perhaps amounts to
the same, as Æthiopia was not in general distinguished from the Higher
or Upper Egypt. Marsham is of opinion that Memnon was the same with
Amenophis, one of the kings of Egypt: while Le Clerc <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘consideres’">considers</ins> him to
have been the same person as Ham, the son of Noah; and Vossius
identifies him with Boalcis, a&nbsp;God of the Syrians. It seems
probable that he was an Egyptian, who had perhaps formed an alliance
with the reigning family of Troy.</p>

they repair to the royal palace, and reclining on lofty couches, with

<i>says</i>, “O&nbsp;chosen priest of Phœbus, am I deceived? or didst
thou not have a son, also, when first I beheld these walls, and twice
two daughters, so far as I remember?” To him Anius replies, shaking his
temples wreathed with snow-white fillets, and says, “Thou art not
mistaken, greatest hero; thou didst see me the parent of five children,
whom now (so great a vicissitude of fortune
<span class = "pagenum">464</span>

assistance is my absent son to me, whom Andros, a&nbsp;land <i>so</i>
called after his name, possesses, holding that place and kingdom on
behalf of his father?</p>

<p>“The Delian <i>God</i> granted him <i>the art of</i> augury; to my
female progeny Liber gave other gifts, exceeding <i>both</i> wishes and
belief. For, at the touch of my daughters, all things were transformed
into corn, and the stream of wine, and the berry of Minerva; and in
these were there rich advantages. When the son of Atreus, the destroyer
of Troy, learned this (that thou mayst not suppose that we, too, did not
in some degree feel your storms) using the force of arms, he dragged
them reluctantly from the bosom of their father, and commanded them to
feed, with their heavenly gifts, the Argive fleet. Whither each of them
could, they made their escape. Eubœa was sought by two; and by as many
of my daughters, was Andros, their brother’s <i>island</i>, sought. The
forces came, and threatened war if they were not given up. Natural
affection, subdued by fear, surrendered to punishment those kindred
breasts; and, that thou mayst be able to forgive a timid brother, there
was no Æneas, no Hector to defend Andros, through whom you
<i>Trojans</i> held out to the tenth year. And now chains were being
provided for their captive arms. Lifting up towards heaven their arms
still free, they said, ‘Father Bacchus, give us thy aid!’ and the author
of their gift did give them aid; if destroying them, in a wondrous
manner, be called giving aid. By what means they lost their shape,
neither could I learn, nor can I now tell. The sum of their calamity is

<p>With such and other discourse, after they have passed the <i>time
of</i> feasting, the table being removed, they seek sleep. And they rise
with the day, and repair to the oracle of Phœbus, who bids them seek the
ancient mother and the kindred shores. The king attends, and presents
them with gifts when about to depart; a&nbsp;sceptre to Anchises,

was. Before the city was a funeral, and tombs, and fires, and funeral
piles; and matrons, with hair dishevelled and naked breasts, expressed
their grief; the Nymphs, too, seem to be weeping, and to mourn their
springs dried up. Without foliage the bared tree runs straight up; the
goats are gnawing the dried stones. Lo! he represents the daughters of
Orion in the middle of Thebes; the one, as presenting her breast, more
than woman’s, with her bared throat; the other, thrusting a sword in her
valorous wounds, as dying for her people, and as being borne, with an
honoured funeral, through the city, and as being burnt in a conspicuous

<p class = "explanation">
Virgil describes Anius as the king of Delos, and the priest of Apollo at
the same time. ‘Rex Anius, rex idem hominum Phœbique sacerdos.’ Æneid,
Book III. He was descended from Cadmus, through his mother Rhea, the
daughter of Staphilus. Having engaged in some intrigue, as Diodorus
Siculus conjectures, her father exposed her on the sea in an open boat,
which drove to Delos, and she was there delivered of Anius, who
afterwards became the king of the island. By his wife Dorippe he had
three daughters, who were extremely frugal, and by means of the
offerings and presents that were brought to the temple of Apollo,
amassed a large store of provisions. During the siege of Troy, the
Greeks sent Palamedes to Delos, to demand food for the army; and, as a
security for his compliance with these demands, they exacted the
daughters of Anius as hostages. The damsels soon afterwards finding
means to escape, it was said that Bacchus, who was their kinsman through
Cadmus, had transformed them into doves. Probably the story of their
transforming every thing they touched, into wine, corn, and oil, was
founded solely on their thriftiness and parsimony. Bochart, however,
explains the story from the circumstance of their names being, as he
conjectures, Oëno, Spermo, and Elaï, which, in the old Phœnician
dialect, signified wine, corn, and oil; and he thinks that the story was
confirmed in general belief by the fact that large quantities of corn,
wine, and oil were supplied from Delos to the Grecian army when before
Troy.</p>

In the reign of Orion, Thebes being devastated by a plague, the oracles
were consulted, and the Thebans were told that the contagion would cease
as soon as the daughters of the king should be sacrificed to the wrath
of heaven. The two maidens immediately presented themselves at the
altar; and on their immolation, the Gods were appeased, and the plague
ceased.
<span class = "pagenum">467</span>
This example of patriotism and fortitude filled the more youthful
Thebans with so much emulation, that they shook off their former
inactivity, and soon became conspicuous for their bravery: which sudden
change gave occasion to the saying, that the ashes of these maidens had
been transformed into men.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Poet follows Æneas on his voyage, to gain an opportunity of
referring to several other current stories. Among other places, he
passes the city of Ambracia, about which the Gods had contended, and
sees the rock into which the umpire of their dispute, who had decided in
favour of Hercules, was changed. Ambracia was on the coast of Epirus,
and gave its name to an adjacent inlet of the sea, called the Ambracian
Gulf. Antoninus Liberalis tells us, on the authority of Nicander, that
Apollo, Diana, and Hercules disputed about this city, and left the
decision to Cragaleus, who gave it in favour of Hercules; on which,
Apollo transformed him into a rock. Very possibly the meaning of this
may be, that when the people of Ambracia were considering to which of
these Deities they should dedicate their city, Cragaleus preferred
Hercules to the other two, or, in other words, the feats of war to the
cultivation of the arts and sciences. Apollo was said to have turned him
into a stone, either because he met with his death near the promontory
where a temple of Apollo stood, or to show the stupidity of his
decision. Antoninus Liberalis is the only writer besides Ovid that makes
mention of the adventure of the sons of the Molossian king; he tells us
that Munychus, king of the Molossi, had three sons, Alcander, Megaletor,
and Philæus, and a daughter named Hyperippe. Some robbers setting fire
to their father’s house, they were transformed by Jupiter into birds.
This, in all probability, is a poetical way of saying that the youths
escaped from the flames, contrary to universal expectation.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The opinions of writers have been very conflicting as to the origin of
the oracle of Dodona. Silius Italicus says that two pigeons flew from
Thebes in Egypt, one of which went to Libya, and occasioned the founding
of the oracle of Jupiter Ammon; while the other settled upon an oak in
Chaonia, and signified thereby to the inhabitants, that it was the will
of heaven that there should be an oracle in that place. Herodotus says
that two priestesses of Egyptian Thebes being carried off by some
Phœnician merchants, one of them was sold to the Greeks, after which she
settled in the forest of Dodona, where a little chapel was founded by
her in honour of Jupiter, in which she gave responses. He adds, that
they called her ‘the dove,’ because being a foreigner they did not
understand her language. At length, having learned the language of the
Pelasgians, it was said that the dove had spoken. On that foundation
grew the tradition that the oaks themselves uttered oracular
responses.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Notwithstanding this plausible account of Herodotus, it is not
impossible that some equivocal expressions in the Hebrew and Arabian
languages may have given rise to the story. ‘Himan,’ in the one
language, signified ‘a priest;’ and ‘Heman,’ in the other, was the name
for ‘a pigeon.’ Possibly those who found the former word in the history
of ancient Greece, written in the dialect of the original Phœnician
settlers, did not understand it, and by their mistake, caused it to be
asserted that a dove had founded the
<span class = "pagenum">468</span>
oracle of Dodona. Bochart tells us that the same word, in the Phœnician
tongue, signifies either ‘pigeons,’ or ‘women;’ but the Abbè Sallier has
gone still further, and has shown that, in the language of the ancient
inhabitants of Epirus, the same word had the two significations
mentioned by Bochart.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
This oracle afterwards grew famous for its responses, and the priests
used considerable ingenuity in the delivery of their answers. They
cautiously kept all who came to consult them at a distance from the dark
recess where the shrine was situated; and took care to deliver their
responses in a manner so ambiguous, as to make people believe whatever
they pleased. In this circumstance originates the variation in the
descriptions of the oracle which the ancients have left us. According to
some, it was the oaks that spoke; according to others, the beeches;
while a third account was that pigeons gave the answers; and, lastly, it
was said that the ringing of certain cauldrons there suspended, divulged
the will of heaven. Stephanus Byzantinus has left a curious account of
this contrivance of the cauldrons; he says that in that part of the
forest of Dodona, where the oracle stood, there were two pillars
erected, at a small distance from each other. On one there was placed a
brazen vessel, about the size of an ordinary cauldron: and on the other
a little boy, which was most probably a piece of mechanism, who held a
brazen whip with several thongs which hung loose, and were easily moved.
When the wind blew, the lashes struck against the vessel, and occasioned
a noise while the wind continued. It was from them, he says, that the
forest took the name of Dodona; ‘dodo,’ in the ancient language,
signifying ‘a cauldron.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Strabo says that the responses were originally given by three
priestesses: and he gives the reason why two priests were afterwards
added to them. The Bœotians having been treacherously attacked by the
people of Thrace during a truce which they had made, went to consult the
oracle of Dodona; and the priestess answering them that if they would
act impiously their design would succeed to their wish, the envoys
suspected that this response had been suggested by the enemy, and burned
her in revenge; after which they vindicated their cruelty by saying that
if the priestess designed to deceive them, she well deserved her
punishment; and that if she spoke with truthfulness, they had only
followed the advice of the oracle. This argument not satisfying the
people of the district, the Bœotian envoys were seized; but as they
pleaded that it was unjust that two women already prejudiced against
them should be their judges, two priests were added to decide the
matter. These, in return for their being the occasion of putting them in
an office so honourable and lucrative, acquitted the Bœotians; whose
fellow countrymen were always in the habit from that time of addressing
the priests when they consulted the oracle. These priests were called by
the name of ‘Selli.’</p>

I have strength proportioned to a body so vast. I&nbsp;will pull out his
palpitating entrails; and I will scatter his torn limbs about the
fields, and throughout thy waves, <i>and</i> thus let him be united to
thee. For I burn: and my passion, <i>thus</i> slighted, rages with the

<p>“Having in vain uttered such complaints (for all this I saw), he
rises; and like an enraged bull, when the heifer is taken away from him,
he could not stand still, and he wandered in the wood, and the well
known forests. When the savage <i>monster</i> espied me, and Acis
unsuspecting and apprehensive of no such thing; and he exclaimed:&mdash;
‘I see you, and I shall cause this to be the last union for your
affection.’ And that voice was as loud as an enraged Cyclop ought,
<i>for his size</i>, to have. Ætna trembled at the noise; but I, struck
with horror, plunged into the adjoining sea. The hero, son of Symæthis,
turned his back and fled, and cried,&mdash; ‘Help me, Galatea,
I&nbsp;entreat thee; help me, ye parents <i>of hers</i>; and admit me,

pursued, and hurled a fragment, torn from the mountain; and though the
extreme angle only of the rock reached him, yet it entirely crushed
Acis. But I did the only thing that was allowed by the Fates to be done,
that Acis might assume the properties of his grandsire. The purple blood
flowed from beneath the rock, and in a little time the redness began to
vanish; and at first it became the colour of a stream muddied by a

Homer, who, in the ninth Book of the Odyssey, has entered fully into the
subject of Polyphemus and the other Cyclops, does not recount this
adventure, which Ovid has borrowed from Theocritus, the Sicilian poet.
Some writers have suggested that Acis was a Sicilian youth, who, having
met with a repulse from Galatea, threw himself into the river, which was
afterwards called by his name. It is, however, more probable that this
river was so called from the rapidity of its course. Indeed, the
scholiast on Theocritus and Eustathius distinctly say that the stream
was called Acis, because the swiftness of its course resembled that of
an arrow, which was called <span class = "greek" title =

<p class = "explanation">
Homer, in describing the Cyclops, informs us that they were a lawless
race, who, neglecting husbandry, lived on the spontaneous produce of a
rich soil, and dwelling in mountain caves, devoted themselves entirely
to the pleasures of a pastoral life. He says that they were men of
monstrous stature, and had but one eye, in the middle of their forehead.
Thucydides supposes them to have been the original inhabitants of
Sicily. As their origin was unknown, it was said that they were the
offspring of Neptune, or, in other words, that they had come by sea, to
settle in Sicily. According to Justin, they retained possession of the
island till the time of Cocalus; but in that point he disagrees with
Homer, who represents them as being in the island after the time of
Cocalus, who was a contemporary of Minos, and lived long before the
Trojan war.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
They inhabited the western parts of Sicily, near the promontories of
Lilybæum and Drepanum; and from that circumstance, according to Bochart,
they received their name. He supposes that the Cyclopes were so called
from the Phœnician compound word Chek-lub, contracted for Chek-le-lub,
which, according to him, was the name of the Gulf of Lilybæum. Because,
in the Greek language <span class = "greek" title =
"kuklos">κυκλὸς</span> signified ‘a circle,’ and <span class = "greek"
title = "ôps">ὤπς</span>, ‘an eye,’ it was given out that the name of
Cyclops was given to them, because they had but one round eye in the
middle of the forehead. It is possible that they may have acquired their
character of being cannibals on true grounds, or, perhaps, only because
they were noted for their extreme cruelty. Living near the volcanic
mountain of Ætna, they were called the workmen of Vulcan; and Virgil
describes them as forging the thunderbolts of Jupiter. Some writers
represent them as having armed the three Deities, who divided the empire
of the world: Jupiter with thunder; Pluto with his helmet; and Neptune
with his trident. Statius represents them as the builders of the walls
of Argos and Virgil as the
<span class = "pagenum">475</span>

the nets that swept up the fish; at another time, seated on a rock,
I&nbsp;managed the line with the rod. The shore was adjacent to a
verdant meadow, one part of which was surrounded with water, the other
with grass, which, neither the horned heifers had hurt with their
browsing, nor had you, ye harmless sheep, nor <i>you</i>, ye shaggy
goats, <i>ever</i> cropped it. No industrious bee took <i>thence</i> the
collected blossoms, no festive garlands were gathered thence for the
head; and no mower’s hands had ever cut it. I&nbsp;was the first to be
seated on that turf, while I was drying the dripping nets. And that I
might count in their order the fish that I had taken; I&nbsp;laid out
those upon it which either chance had driven to my nets, or their own
credulity to my barbed hooks.</p>

<p>“The thing is like a fiction (but of what use is it to me to coin
fictions?); on touching the grass my prey began to move, and to shift
their sides, and to skip about on the land, as though in the sea. And
while I both paused and wondered, the whole batch flew off to the waves,
and left behind their new master and the shore. I&nbsp;was amazed, and,
in doubt for a long time, I&nbsp;considered what could be the cause;
whether some Divinity had done this, or whether the juice of <i>some</i>
herb. ‘And yet,’ said I, ‘what herb has these properties?’ and with my
hand I plucked the grass, and I chewed it, <i>so</i> plucked, with my
teeth. Hardly had my throat well swallowed the unknown juices, when I
suddenly felt my entrails inwardly throb, and my mind taken possession
of by the passions of another nature. Nor could I stay in <i>that</i>
place; and I exclaimed, ‘Farewell, land, never more to be revisited;’
and plunged my body beneath the deep. The Gods of the sea vouchsafed me,
on being received by them, kindred honours, and they entreated Oceanus
and Tethys to take away from me whatever mortality I bore. By them was I
purified; and a charm being repeated over me nine times, that washes
away <i>all</i> guilt, I&nbsp;was commanded to put my breast beneath a
hundred streams.</p>

<p>“There was no delay; rivers issuing from different springs, and whole
seas, were poured over my head. Thus far I can

<span class = "linenum">xiii. 956-968.</span>
relate to thee what happened worthy to be related, and thus far do I
remember; but my understanding was not conscious of the rest. When it
returned <i>to me</i>, I&nbsp;found myself different throughout all my
body from what I was before, and not the same in mind. Then, for the
first time, did I behold this beard, green with its deep colour, and my
flowing hair, which I sweep along the spacious seas, and my huge
shoulders, and my azurecoloured arms, and the extremities of my legs
tapering in <i>the form of</i> a finny fish. But still, what does this
form avail me, what to have pleased the ocean Deities, <i>and</i> what
to be a God, if thou art not moved by these things?”</p>

<p>As he was saying such things as these, and about to say still more,
Scylla left the God. He was enraged, and, provoked at the repulse, he
repaired to the marvellous court of Circe, the daughter of Titan.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The ancient writers mention three persons of the name of Glaucus: one
was the son of Minos, the second of Hippolochus, and the third is the
one here mentioned. Strabo calls him the son of Polybus, while other
writers make him to have been the son of Phorbas, and others of Neptune.
Being drowned, perhaps by accident, to do honour to his memory, it was
promulgated that he had become a sea God, and the city of Anthedon, of
which he was a native, worshipped him as such.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Athenæus says that he carried off Ariadne from the isle of Naxos, where
Theseus had left her; on which Bacchus punished him by binding him to a
vine. According to Diodorus Siculus, he appeared to the Argonauts, when
overtaken by a storm. From Apollonius Rhodius we learn that he foretold
to them that Hercules, and Castor and Pollux, would be received into the
number of the Gods. It was also said, that in the battle which took
place between Jason and the Tyrrhenians, he was the only person that
escaped unwounded. Euripides, who is followed by Pausanias, says that he
was the interpreter of Nereus, and was skilled in prophecy; and Nicander
even says that it was from him that Apollo learned the art of
prediction. Strabo and Philostratus say that he was metamorphosed into a
Triton, which is a-kin to the description of his appearance here given
by Ovid.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The place where he leaped into the sea was long remembered; and in the
days of Pausanias ‘Glaucus’ Leap’ was still pointed out by the people of
Anthedon. It is not improbable that he drowned himself for some reason
which tradition failed to hand down to posterity.</p>

Ulysses adopted to avoid going to the Trojan war. Pretending to be
seized with madness, he ploughed the sea-shore, and sowed it with salt.

before the plough; on which Ulysses turned on one side, to avoid hurting
the child, which was considered a proof that his madness was not
real.</p>

Priam, in which the king thanked Palamedes for his intended assistance
to the Trojan cause, and begged to present him a sum of money. By
bribing the servants of Palamedes, he caused a large quantity of gold to
be buried in the ground, under his tent. He then caused the letter to be
intercepted, and to be carried to Agamemnon. On the appearance of
Palamedes to answer the charge, Ulysses appeared seemingly as his
friend, and suggested, that if no gold should be found in his
possession, he must be innocent. The gold, however, being found,
Palamedes was stoned to death.</p>

arrows of Hercules, without the presence of which Troy could not be
taken. Accompanying the Greeks to the Trojan war, he was wounded in the

offensive, that, by the advice of Ulysses, he was left behind, in the
island of Lemnos, one of the Cyclades.</p>

hands through the Etrurian seas, Glaucus arrived at the grass-clad
hills, and the halls of Circe, the daughter of the Sun, filled with
various wild beasts. Soon as he beheld her, after salutations were given
and received, he said, “Do thou, a&nbsp;Goddess, have compassion on me a
God; for thou alone (should I only seem deserving of it,) art able to
relieve this passion <i>of mine</i>. Daughter of Titan, by none is it
better known how great is the power of herbs, than by me, who have been

virtues of powerful herbs. But I do not request thee to cure me, and to
heal these wounds; and there is no necessity for an end <i>to them;
but</i> let her share in the flame.” But Circe, (for no one has a temper
more susceptible of such a passion, whether it is that the cause of it
originates in herself, or whether it is that Venus, offended<a class =

her who despises thee; her, who is attached to thee, repay by like
attachment, and, by one act, take vengeance on two individuals.”</p>

<p>Glaucus answered her, making such attempts as these,&mdash; “Sooner
shall foliage grow in the ocean, and <i>sooner</i> shall sea-weed spring
up on the tops of the mountains, than my affections shall change, while
Scylla is alive.” The Goddess is indignant; and since she is not able to
injure him, and as she loves him she does not wish <i>to do so</i>, she
is enraged against her, who has been preferred to herself; and, offended
with these crosses in love, she immediately bruises herbs, infamous for
their horrid juices, and, when bruised, she mingles with them the
incantations of Hecate. She puts on azure vestments too, and through the
troop of fawning wild beasts she issues from the midst of her hall; and
making for Rhegium, opposite to the rocks of Zancle, she enters the
waves boiling with the tides; on these, as though on the firm shore, she
impresses her footsteps, and with dry feet she skims along the surface
of the waves.</p>

<p>There was a little bay, curving in <i>the shape of</i> a bent bow,

influence both of the sea and of the weather, when the sun was at its
height in his mid career, and made the smallest shadow from the head
<i>downwards</i>. This the Goddess infects beforehand, and pollutes it
with monster-breeding drugs; on it she sprinkles the juices distilled

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
According to Hesiod, Circe was the daughter of the Sun and of the Nymph
Perse, and the sister of Pasiphaë, the wife of Minos. Homer makes her
the sister of Æetes, the king of Colchis, while other authors represent
her as the daughter of that monarch, and the sister of Medea. Being
acquainted with the properties of simples, and having used her art in
mixing poisonous draughts, she was generally looked upon as a sorceress.
Apollonius Rhodius says that she poisoned her husband, the king of the
Sarmatians, and that her father Apollo rescued her from the rage of her
subjects, by transporting her in his chariot into Italy. Virgil and Ovid
say that she inhabited one of the promontories of Italy, which
afterwards bore her name, and which at the present day is known by the
name of Monte Circello.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">481</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 75-76.</span>
<p class = "explanation">
It is not improbable that the person who went by the name of Circe was
never in Colchis or Thrace, and that she was styled the sister of Medea,
merely on account of the similarity of their characters; that they both
were called daughters of the Sun, because they understood the properties
of simples; and that their pretended enchantments were only a poetical
mode of describing the effect of their beauty, which drew many suitors
after them, who lost themselves in the dissipation of a voluptuous life.
Indeed, Strabo says, and very judiciously, as it would seem, that Homer
having heard persons mention the expedition of Jason to Colchis, and
hearing the stories of Medea and Circe, he took occasion to say, from
the resemblance of their characters, that they were sisters.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
According to some authors, Scylla was the daughter of Phorcys and
Hecate; but as other writers say, of Typhon. Homer describes her in the
following terms:&mdash; ‘She had a voice like that of a young whelp; no
man, not even a God, could behold her without horror. She had twelve
feet, six long necks, and at the end of each a monstrous head, whose
mouth was provided with a triple row of teeth.’ Another ancient writer
says, that these heads were those of an insect, a&nbsp;dog, a&nbsp;lion,
a&nbsp;whale, a&nbsp;Gorgon, and a human being. Virgil has in a great
measure followed the description given by Homer. Between Messina and
Reggio there is a narrow strait, where high crags project into the sea
on each side. The part on the Sicilian side was called Charybdis, and
that on the Italian shore was named Scylla. This spot has ever been
famous for its dangerous whirlpools, and the extreme difficulty of its
navigation. Several rapid currents meeting there, and the tide running
through the strait with great impetuosity, the sea sends forth a dismal
noise, not unlike that of the howling or barking of dogs, as Virgil has
expressed it, in the words, ‘Multis circum latrantibus undis.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Palæphatus and Fusebius, not satisfied with the story being based on
such simple facts, assert that Scylla was a ship that belonged to
certain Etrurian pirates, who used to infest the coasts of Sicily, and
that it had the figure of a woman carved on its head, whose lower parts
were surrounded with dogs. According to these writers, Ulysses escaped
them; and then, using the privileges of a traveller, told the story to
the credulous Phæacians in the marvellous terms in which Homer has
related it. Bochart, however, says that the two names were derived from
the Phœnician language, in which ‘Scol,’ the root of Scylla, signified
‘a ruin,’ and Charybdis, ‘a gulf.’</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Although Ovid passes over the particulars of the visit of Æneas to Dido,
and only mentions her death incidentally, we may give a few words to a
story which has been rendered memorable by the beautiful poem of Virgil.
Elisa, or Dido, was the daughter of Belus, king of Tyre. According to
Justin, at his death he left his crown to his son Pygmalion jointly with
Dido, who was a woman of extraordinary beauty. She was afterwards
married to her uncle Sicharbas, who is called Sichæus by Virgil. Being
priest of Hercules, an office next in rank to that of king, he was
possessed of immense treasures, which the known avarice of Pygmalion
caused him to conceal in the earth. Pygmalion having caused him to be
assassinated, at which Dido first expressed great resentment, she
afterwards pretended a reconciliation, the better to cover the design
which she had formed to escape from the kingdom.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Having secured the cooperation of several of the discontented Tyrians,
she requested permission to visit Tyre, and to leave her melancholy
retreat, where every thing contributed to increase her misery by
recalling the remembrance of her deceased husband. Hoping to seize her
treasures, Pygmalion granted her request. Putting her wealth on board
ship, she mixed some bags filled with sand among those that contained
gold, for the purpose of deceiving those whom the king had sent to
observe her and to escort her to Tyre. When out at sea, she threw the
bags overboard, to appease the spirit of her husband, as she pretended,
by sacrificing those treasures that had cost him his life. Then
addressing the officers that accompanied her, she assured them that they
would meet with but a bad reception from the king for having permitted
so much wealth to be wasted, and that it would be more advantageous for
them to fly from his resentment. The officers embarking in her design,
after they had taken on board some Tyrian nobles, who were privy to the
plan, she offered sacrifice to Hercules, and again set sail. Landing in
Cyprus, they carried off eighty young women, who were married to her
companions. On discovering her flight, Pygmalion at first intended to
pursue her; but the intreaties of his mother, and the remonstrances of
the priests, caused him to abandon his design.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Having arrived on the coast of Africa, Dido bargained with the
inhabitants of the coast for as much ground as she could encompass with
a bull’s hide. This being granted, she cut the hide into as many thongs
as enclosed ground sufficient to build a fort upon; which was in
consequence called<ins class = "correction" title = "‘ missing">
‘</ins>Byrsa.’ In making the foundation, an ox’s head was dug&nbsp;up,
<span class = "pagenum">484</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 101-102.</span>
which being supposed to portend slavery to the city, if built there,
they removed to another spot, where, in digging, they found a horse’s
head, which was considered to be a more favourable omen. The story of
the citadel being named from the bull’s hide was very probably invented
by the Greeks; who, finding in the Phœnician narrative of the foundation
of Carthage, the citadel mentioned by the Tyrian name of ‘Bostra,’ which
had that signification, and fancying, from its resemblance to their word
<span class = "greek" title = "bursa">βυρσὰ</span>, that it was derived
from it, invented the fable of the hide.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Being pressed by Iarbas, king of Mauritania, to marry him, she asked for
three months to come to a determination. The time expiring, she ordered
a sacrifice to be made as an expiation to her husband’s shade, and
caused a pile to be erected, avowedly for the purpose of burning all
that belonged to him. Ascending it, she pretended to expedite the
sacrifice, and then despatched herself with a poniard. Virgil, wishing
to deduce the hatred of the Romans and Carthaginians from the very time
of Æneas, invented the story of the visit of Æneas to Dido; though he
was perhaps guilty of a great anachronism in so doing, as the taking of
Troy most probably preceded the foundation of Carthage by at least two
centuries. Ovid has also related her story at length in the third book
of the Fasti, and has followed Virgil’s account of the treacherous
conduct of Æneas, while he represents Iarbas as capturing her city after
her death, and driving her sister Anna into exile. In the Phœnician
language the word ‘Dido’ signified ‘the bold woman,’ and it is probable
that Elisa only received that name after her death. Bochart has taken
considerable pains to prove that she was the aunt of Jezebel, the
famous, or rather infamous, wife of King Ahab.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Poet then proceeds to say that Æneas saw the islands of the
Cercopians on his way, whom Jupiter had transformed into apes. Æschines
and Suidas say that there were two notorious robbers, inhabitants of an
island adjacent to Sicily, named Candulus and Atlas, who committed
outrages on all who approached the island. Being about to insult Jupiter
himself, he transformed them into apes, from which circumstance the
island received its name of Pithecusa. Sabinus says that they were
called Cercopes, because in their treachery they were like monkeys, who
fawn with their tails, when they design nothing but mischief. Zenobius
places the Cercopes in Libya; and says that they were changed into
rocks, for having offered to fight with Hercules.</p>

may visit the shade of his father. But she raises her countenance,
a&nbsp;long time fixed on the ground; and at length, inspired by the
influence of the God, she says, “Thou dost request a great thing,

flames. Yet, Trojan, lay aside <i>all</i> apprehension, thou shalt

dread Orcus, and his own ancestors, and the aged ghost of the
magnanimous Anchises; he learned, too, the ordinances of <i>those</i>
regions, and what dangers would have to be undergone by him in his
future wars. Tracing back thence his weary steps along the path, he
beguiled his labour in discourse with his Cumæan guide. And while he was
pursuing his frightful journey along darkening shades, he said, “Whether
thou art a Goddess personally, or whether <i>thou art but a woman</i>
most favoured by the Deities, to me shalt thou always be equal to a
Divinity; I&nbsp;will confess, too, that I exist through thy kindness,
who hast willed that I should visit the abodes of death, and that I
should escape those abodes of death <i>when</i> beheld <i>by me</i>. For
this kindness, when I have emerged into the breezes of the air,
I&nbsp;will erect a temple to thee, <i>and</i> I will give thee the
honours of frankincense.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">486</span>

<p>The prophetess looks upon him, and, with heaving sighs, she says,
“Neither am I a Goddess, nor do thou honour a human being with the
tribute of the holy frankincense. And, that thou mayst not err in
ignorance, life eternal and without end was offered me, had my virginity
but yielded to Phœbus, in love <i>with me</i>. But while he was hoping
for this, while he was desiring to bribe me beforehand with gifts, he
said: ‘Maiden of Cumæ, choose whatever thou mayst wish, thou shalt gain
thy wish.’ I, pointing to a heap of collected dust, inconsiderately
asked that as many birth-days might be my lot, as the dust contained
particles. It escaped me to desire as well, at the same time, years
vigorous with youth. But yet he offered me these, and eternal youth, had
I submitted to his desires. Having rejected the offers of Phœbus,
I&nbsp;remain unmarried. But now my more vigorous years have passed by,
and crazy old age approaches with its trembling step, and this must I
long endure.</p>

<p>“For thou beholdest me, having now lived seven ages; it remains for
me to equal the number of particles of the dust; <i>yet</i> to behold
three hundred harvests, <i>and</i> three hundred vintages. The time will
come, when length of days will make me diminutive from a person so
large; and when my limbs, wasted by old age, will be reduced to the most
trifling weight. <i>Then</i> I shall not seem to have <i>once</i> been
beloved, nor <i>once</i> to have pleased a God. Even Phœbus himself
will, perhaps, not recognize me; or, <i>perhaps</i>, he will deny that
he loved me. To that degree shall I be said to be changed; and though

in defence of Christianity, made use of the Sibylline verses of the
ancients. The Emperor Constantine, too, in his harangue before the
Nicene Council, quoted them, as redounding to the advantage of
Christianity; although he then stated that many persons did not believe
that the Sibyls were the authors of them. St. Augustin, too, employs
several of their alleged predictions to enforce the truths of the
Christian religion.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Sebastian Castalio has warmly maintained the truth of the oracles
contained in these verses, though he admits that they have been very
much interpolated. Other writers, however, having carefully examined
them, have pronounced them to be spurious, and so many pious frauds;
which, perhaps, may be pronounced to be the general opinion at the
present day. We will, however, shortly enquire how many Sibyls of
<span class = "pagenum">487</span>
antiquity there were, and when they lived; whether any of their works
were ever promulgated for the perusal of the public, and whether the
verses which still exist under their name have any ground to be
considered genuine.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
There is no doubt but that in ancient times there existed certain women,
who, led by a frenzied enthusiasm, uttered obscure sentences, which
passed for predictions with the credulous people who went to consult
them. Virgil and Ovid represent Æneas as going to the cave of the Cumæan
Sibyl, to learn from her the success of the wars he should be engaged
in. Plato, Strabo, Plutarch, Pliny, Solinus, and Pausanias, with many
other writers, have mentioned the Sibyls; and it would be absurd, with
Faustus Socinus, to affirm that no Sibyls ever existed. Indeed, Plato
and other authors of antiquity go so far as to say, that by their
productions they were essentially the benefactors of mankind. Some
mention but one Sibyl, who was born either at Babylon or at Erythræ, in
Phrygia. Diodorus Siculus mentions one only, and assigns Delphi as her
locality, calling her by the name of Daphne. Strabo and Stephanus
Byzantinus mention two, the one of Gergæ, a&nbsp;little town near Troy,
and the other of Mermessus, in the same country. Solinus reckons three;
the Delphian, named Herophile, the Erythræan, and the Cumæan. According
to Varro, their number amounted to ten, whose names, in the order of
time which Pausanias assigns them, were as follows:</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The first and the most ancient was the Delphian, who lived before the
Trojan war. The second was the Erythræan, who was said to have been the
first composer of acrostic verses, and who also lived before the Trojan
war. The third was the Cumæan, who was mentioned by Nævius in his book
on the first Punic war, and by Piso in his annals. She is the Sibyl
spoken of in the Æneid, and her name was Deïphobe. The fourth was the
Samian, called Pitho, though Eusebius calls her Herophile, and he makes
her to have lived about the time of Numa Pompilius. The fifth, whose
name was Amalthea, or Demophile, lived at Cumæ, in Asia Minor. The sixth
was the Hellespontine Sibyl, born at Mermessus, near Troy. The seventh
was the Libyan, mentioned by Euripides. Some suppose that she was the
first who had the name of Sibyl, which was given to her by the people of
Africa. The eighth was the Persian or Babylonian Sibyl, whom Suidas
names Sambetha. The ninth was the Phrygian, who delivered her oracles at
Ancyra, in Phrygia. The tenth was the Tiburtine, who was called Albunea,
and prophesied near Tibur, or Tivoli, on the banks of the Anio. In the
present story Ovid evidently intends to represent these various Sibyls
as being the same person; and to account for her prolonged existence, by
representing that Apollo had granted her a life to last for many
ages.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Several ages before the Christian era, the Romans had a collection of
verses, which were commonly attributed to the Sibyls. These they often
consulted; and in the time of Tarquinius Superbus, two officers were
appointed for the purpose of keeping the Sibylline books, whose business
it was to look in them on the occasion of any public calamity, in order
to see whether it had been foretold and to make their report to the
Senate. The books were kept in a stone chest, beneath the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus. These Duumvirs continued until the year of Rome
388, when eight others being added, they formed the College of the
Decemvirs.
<span class = "pagenum">488</span>
About eighty-three years before the Christian era five other keepers of
these books were added, who thus formed the body called the
Quindecimvirs.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Aulus Gellius, Servius, and many other
writers, state the following as the origin of the Sibylline books. An
aged woman presented to Tarquinius Superbus <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: error for nine">three</ins> books that
contained the oracles of the Sibyls, and demanded a large sum for them.
The king refusing to buy them, she went and burned them; and returning,
asked the same price for the remaining six, as she had done for the
original number. Being again repulsed, she burnt three more, and coming
back again, demanded the original price for the three that remained.
Astonished at the circumstance, the king bought the books. Pliny and
Solinus vary the story a little, in saying that the woman at first
presented but three books, and that she destroyed two of them.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is generally supposed, that on the burning of the Capitol, about
eighty-three years before the Christian era, the Sibylline books of
Tarquinius Superbus were destroyed in the flames. To repair the loss,
the Romans despatched officers to various cities of Italy, and even to
Asia and Africa, to collect whatever they could find, under the name of
Sibylline oracles. P. Gabinius, M. Ottacilius, and L. Valerius brought
back a large collection, of which the greater part was rejected, and the
rest committed to the care of the Quindecimvirs. Augustus ordered a
second revision of them; and, after a severe scrutiny, those which were
deemed to be genuine, were deposited in a box, under a statue of Apollo
Palatinus. Tiberius again had them examined, and some portion of them
was then rejected. Finally, about the year <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 399, Stilcho, according to Rutilius Numatianus,
or rather, the Emperor Honorius himself, ordered them to be burnt.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The so-called collection of Sibylline verses which now exists is
generally looked upon as spurious; or if any part is genuine, it bears
so small a proportion to the fictitious portion, that it has shared in
the condemnation. Indeed, their very distinctness stamps them as
forgeries; for they speak of the mysteries of Christianity in
undisguised language, and the names of our Saviour and the Virgin Mary
occur as openly as they do in the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is a singular assertion of St. Jerome, that the gift of prophecy was
a reward to the Sibyls for their chastity. If such was the condition, we
have a right to consider that the Deities were very partial in the
distribution of their rewards, and in withholding them from the
multitudes who, we are bound in charity to believe, were as deserving as
the Sibyls themselves of the gift of vaticination.</p>

though I were to do everything <i>possible</i>, I&nbsp;could never be

were, even now, to leave the light of life, I&nbsp;should either be
buried in a tomb, or, at least, not in that paunch <i>of his</i>. What
were my feelings at that moment (unless, indeed, terror deprived me of
all sense and feeling), when, left behind, I&nbsp;saw you making for the
open sea? I&nbsp;wished to shout aloud, but I was fearful of betraying

him when, having torn up a mountain, he hurled the immense rock in the
midst of the waves; again I beheld him hurling huge stones, with his
giant arms, just as though impelled by the powers of the engine of war.
And, forgetful that I was not in it, I&nbsp;was now struck with horror
lest the waves or the stones might overwhelm the ship.</p>

<p>“But when your flight had saved you from a cruel death, he, indeed,
roaring with rage, paced about all Ætna, and groped out the woods with
his hands, and, deprived of his eye, stumbled against the rocks; and
stretching out his arms, stained with gore, into the sea, he cursed the
Grecian race, and he said, ‘Oh! that any accident would bring back
Ulysses to me, or any one of his companions, against whom my anger might
find vent, whose entrails I might devour, whose living limbs I might
mangle with my right hand, whose blood might drench my throat, whose
crushed members might quiver beneath my teeth: how insignificant, or how
trifling, <i>then</i>, would be the loss of my sight, that has been
taken from me!’ This, and more, he said in his rage. Ghastly horror took
possession of me, as I beheld his features, streaming even yet with
blood, and the ruthless hands, and the round space deprived of the eye,
and his limbs, and his beard matted with human blood. Death was before
my eyes, <i>and</i> yet that was the least of my woes. I&nbsp;imagined

mind was fixed the impress of that time when I beheld two bodies of my
companions three or four times dashed against the ground. Throwing
himself on the top of them, just like a shaggy lion, he stowed away
their entrails, their flesh, their bones with the white marrow, and
their quivering limbs, in his ravenous paunch. A&nbsp;trembling seized
me; in my alarm I stood without blood <i>in my features</i>, as I beheld

<p>“Concealing myself for many a day, and trembling at every sound, and
both fearing death and <i>yet</i> desirous to die, satisfying hunger
with acorns, and with grass mixed with leaves, alone, destitute,
desponding, abandoned to death and destruction, after a length of time,
I&nbsp;beheld a ship not far off; by signs I prayed for deliverance, and
I ran down to the shore; I&nbsp;prevailed; and a Trojan ship received
me, a&nbsp;Greek. Do thou too, dearest of my companions, relate thy
adventures, and those of thy chief, and of the company, which, together

<p>The other relates how that Æolus rules over the Etrurian seas; Æolus,
the grandson of Hippotas, who confines the winds in their prison, which
the Dulichean chief had received, shut up in a leather <i>bag</i>,
a&nbsp;wondrous gift; how, with a favouring breeze, he had proceeded for
nine days, and had beheld the land he was bound for; <i>and how</i>,
when the first morning after the ninth had arrived, his companions,
influenced by envy and a desire for booty, supposing it to be gold, had
cut the fastenings of the winds; <i>and how</i>, through these, the ship
had gone back along the waves through which it had just come, and had
returned to the harbour of the Æolian king.</p>

<p>“Thence,” said he, “we came to the ancient city<a class = "tag" name

by me and one companion, by flight; the third of us stained the accursed
jaws of the Læstrygon with his blood. Antiphates pursued us as we fled,
and called together his followers; they flocked together, and, without
intermission, they showered both stones and beams, and they overwhelmed
men, and ships, too, did they overwhelm; yet one, which carried us and
Ulysses himself, escaped. A&nbsp;part of our companions <i>thus</i>

<p class = "explanation">
Æolus, according to Servius and Varro, was the son of Hippotas, and
about the time of the Trojan war reigned in those islands, which were
formerly called ‘Vulcaniæ,’ but were afterwards entitled ‘Æoliæ,’ and
are now known as the Lipari Islands. Homer mentions only one of these
islands, which were seven in number. He calls it by the name of Æolia,
and probably means the one which was called Lipara, and gave its name to
the group, and which is now known as Strombolo. Æolus seems to have been
a humane prince, who received with hospitality those who had the
misfortune to be cast on his island. Diodorus Siculus says that he was
especially careful to warn strangers of the shoals and dangerous places
in the neighbouring seas. Pliny adds, that he applied himself to the
study of the winds, by observing the direction of the smoke of the
volcanos, with which the isles abounded.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Being considered as an authority on that subject, at a time when
navigation was so little reduced to an art, the poets readily feigned
that he was the master of the winds, and kept them pent up in caverns,
under his control. The story of the winds being entrusted to Ulysses,
which Ovid here copies from Homer, is merely a poetical method of
saying, that Ulysses disregarded the advice of Æolus, and staying out at
sea beyond the time he had been recommended, was caught in a violent
tempest. It is possible that Homer may allude to some custom which
prevailed among the ancients, similar to that of the Lapland witches in
modern times, who pretend to sell a favourable wind, enclosed in a bag,
to mariners. Homer speaks of the six sons and six daughters of Æolus;
perhaps they were the twelve principal winds, upon which he had expended
much pains in making accurate observations.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Bochart suggests that the isle of Lipara was called by the Phœnicians
‘Nibara,’ on account of its volcano, (that word signifying ‘a torch,’)
which name was afterwards corrupted to Lipara.</p>

she ordered the grains of parched barley to be mingled, and honey, and
the strength of wine, and curds with pressed milk. Secretly, she added
drugs to be concealed beneath this sweetness. We received the cups
presented by her sacred right hand. Soon as, in our thirst, we quaffed
them with parching mouth, and the ruthless Goddess, with her wand,
touched the extremity of our hair (I&nbsp;am both ashamed, and
<i>yet</i> I will tell of it), I&nbsp;began to grow rough with bristles,
and no longer to be able to speak; and, instead of words, to utter a

too, my mouth receive a hard skin, with its crooked snout, and my neck
swell with muscles; and with the member with which, the moment before,

I&nbsp;had received the cup, with the same did I impress my

<p>“With the rest who had suffered the same treatment (so powerful are
enchanted potions) I&nbsp;was shut up in a pig-sty; and we perceived
that Eurylochus, alone, had not the form of a swine; he, alone, escaped
the proffered draught. And had he not escaped it, I&nbsp;should even, at
this moment, have still been one of the bristle-clad animals; nor would
Ulysses, having been informed by him of so direful a disaster, have come
to Circe as <i>our</i> avenger. The Cyllenian peace-bearer had given him
a white flower; the Gods above call it ‘Moly;’<a class = "tag" name =

a black root. Protected by that, and at the same time by the instruction
of the inhabitants of heaven, he entered the dwelling of Circe, and
being invited to the treacherous draughts, he repelled her, while
endeavouring to stroke his hair with her wand, and prevented her, in her
terror, with his drawn sword. Upon that, her promise <i>was given</i>,
and right hands were exchanged; and, being received into her couch, he
required the bodies of his companions as his marriage gift.</p>

<p>“We are <i>then</i> sprinkled with the more favouring juices of
harmless plants, and are smitten on the head with a blow from her
inverted wand; and charms are repeated, the converse of the charms that
had been uttered. The longer she chaunts them, the more erect are we
raised from the ground; and the bristles fall off, and the fissure
leaves our cloven feet; our shoulders return; our arms become attached<a

things I heard with my ears. This, too, among many other things

on its head, erected in the hallowed temple, and bedecked with many a
chaplet. When I asked, and desired to know who he was, and why he was
venerated in the sacred temple, and why he carried that bird; she
said:&mdash; ‘Listen, Macareus, learn hence, too, what is the power of

Ulysses having stayed some time at the court of Circe, where all were
immersed in luxury and indolence, begins to reflect on the degraded
state to which he is reduced, and resolutely abandons so unworthy a mode
of life. This resolution is here typified by the herb moly, the symbol
of wisdom. His companions, changed into swine, are emblems of the
condition to which a life of sensuality reduces its votaries; while the
wolves, lions, and horses show that man in such a condition fails not to
exhibit the various bad propensities of the brute creation. Thus was the
prodigal son, mentioned in the New Testament, reduced to a level with
the brutes, ‘and fain would have filled his belly with the husks that
the swine did eat.’</p>

It is not improbable that Circe was the original from which the Eastern
romancer depicted the enchantress queen Labè in the story of Beder and
Giauhare in the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. They were both ladies of
light reputation, both fond of exercising their magical power on
strangers, and in exactly the same manner: and as Ulysses successfully
resisted the charms of Circe, so Beder thwarted the designs of Labè; but
here the parallel ends.</p>

the rocks, and to tame the wild beasts, and to stop <i>the course of</i>
the long rivers, and to detain the fleeting birds. While she was singing
her songs with her feminine voice, Picus had gone from his dwelling into
the Laurentine fields, to pierce the wild boars there bred; and he was
pressing the back of his spirited horse, and was carrying two javelins
in his left hand, having a purple cloak fastened with yellow gold. The
daughter of the Sun, too, had come into the same wood; and that she
might pluck fresh plants on the fruitful hills, she had left behind the
Circæan fields, <i>so</i> called after her own name.</p>

astounded; the plants which she had gathered fell from her bosom, and a
flame seemed to pervade her entire marrow. As soon as she regained her
presence of mind from <i>so</i> powerful a shock, she was about to
confess what she desired; the speed of his horse, and the surrounding
guards, caused that she

be borne on the winds, if I only know myself, if all potency in herbs
has not vanished, and if my charms do not deceive me.’ <i>Thus</i> she
said; and she formed the phantom of a fictitious wild boar, with no
substance, and commanded it to run past the eyes of the king, and to
seem to go into a forest, thick set with trees, where the wood is most
dense, and where the spot is inaccessible to a horse. There is no delay;
Picus, forthwith, unconsciously follows the phantom of the prey; hastily
too, he leaves the reeking back of his steed, and, in pursuit of a vain
hope, wanders on foot in the lofty forest. She repeats prayers to
herself, and utters magical incantations, and adores strange Gods in
strange verses, with which she is wont both to darken the disk of the
snow-white moon, and to draw the clouds that suck up the moisture, over
the head of her father. Then does the sky become lowering at the
repeating of the incantation, and the ground exhales its vapours; and
his companions wander along the darkened paths, and his guards are
separated from the king.</p>

<p>“‘She, having now gained a <i>favourable</i> place and opportunity,
says, ‘O, most beauteous <i>youth</i>! by thy eyes, which have
captivated mine, and by this graceful person, which makes me, though a
Goddess, to be thy suppliant, favour my passion, and receive the Sun,
that beholds all things, as thy father-in-law, and do not in thy cruelty
despise Circe, the daughter of Titan.’ <i>Thus</i> she says. He roughly
repels her and her entreaties: and he says, ‘Whoever thou art, I&nbsp;am
not for thee; another female holds me enthralled, and for a long space
of time, I&nbsp;pray, may she so hold me. I&nbsp;will not pollute the
conjugal ties with the love of a stranger, while the Fates shall
preserve for me Canens, the daughter of Janus.’ The daughter of Titan,
having often repeated her entreaties in vain, says, ‘Thou shalt not
depart with impunity, nor shalt thou return to Canens; and by experience
shalt thou learn what one slighted, what one in love, what a woman, can
do; but that one in love, and slighted, and a woman, is Circe.’</p>

repeat. He fled; wondering that he sped more swiftly than usual<ins

Gods of Night, from Erebus and from Chaos, and she invokes Hecate in
magic howlings. Wondrous to tell, the woods leap from their spot; the
ground utters groans, the neighbouring trees become pallid, the grass
becomes moist, besprinkled with drops of blood; the stones seem to send
forth harsh lowings, the dogs <i>seem</i> to bark, and the ground to
grow loathsome with black serpents, and unsubstantial ghosts of the
departed <i>appear</i> to flit about. The multitude trembles, astonished
at these prodigies; she touches their astonished faces, as they tremble,

in her distraction, she wanders through the Latian fields. Six nights,

and of food, going over hills and valleys, wherever chance led her.
Tiber, last <i>of all</i>, beheld her, worn out with weeping and
wandering, and reposing her body on his cold banks. There, with tears,
she poured forth words attuned, lamenting, in a low voice, her very

dirge.</p>

pined away, and by degrees vanished into light air. Yet the Fame of it
became attached to the spot, which the ancient Muses have properly
called Canens, after the name of the Nymph.’ During that long year, many
such things as these were told me and were seen <i>by me</i>. Sluggish
and inactive through idleness, we were ordered again to embark on the

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
When names occur in the ancient Mythology, of Oriental origin, we may
conclude that they were imported into Greece and Italy from Egypt or
Phœnicia; and that their stories were derived from the same sources;
such as those of Adonis, Arethusa, Arachne, and Isis. Those that are
derived from the Greek languages are attached to fictions of purely
Greek origin, such as the fables of Daphne, Galantis, Cygnus, and the
Myrmidons; and where the names are of Latin original, we may conclude
that their stories originated in Italy: such, for instance, as those of
Canens, Picus, Anna Perenna, Flora, Quirinus, and others.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
To this rule there are certain exceptions; for both Greece and Italy
occasionally appropriated each other’s traditions, by substituting the
names of one language for those of the other. Thus it would not be safe
to affirm positively that the story of Portumnus and Matuta is of Latin
origin, since Greece lays an equal claim to it under the names of
Leucothoë and Palæmon, while, probably, Cadmus originally introduced it
from Phœnicia, under the names of Ino and Melicerta.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, on the authority of Cato the Censor and
Asellius Sempronius, says that the original inhabitants of Italy were a
Greek colony. Cato and Sempronius state that they were from Achaia,
while Dionysius says that they came from Arcadia, under the command
<span class = "pagenum">500</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 441-456.</span>
of Œnotrius. Picus is generally supposed to have been one of the
aboriginal kings of Italy, who was afterwards Deified. Servius, in his
Commentary on the seventh Book of the Æneid, informs us that Picus
pretended to know future events, and made use of a woodpecker, which he
had tamed, for the purpose of his auguries. On this ground, after his
death, it was generally reported that he had been transformed into that
bird, and he was ranked among the Dii Indigetes of Latium. Dying in his
youth, his wife Canens retired to a solitary spot, where she ended her
life, and the intensity of her grief gave rise to the fable that she had
pined away into a sound.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It has been suggested that the story took its rise from the oracles of
Mars among the Sabines, when a woodpecker was said to give the
responses. According to Bochart, it arose from the confusion of the
meaning of the Phœnician word ‘picea,’ which signified a ‘diviner.’ It
is the exuberant fancy of Ovid alone which connects Picus with the story
of Circe.</p>

<p>But after Venulus had executed the commands of Turnus, and had asked

was not wishful to commit the subjects of his father-in-law to a war,
and that he had no men to arm of the nation of his own countrymen; “And

and so great hardships did I endure on the deep ocean, so great amid
arms on shore, that many a time were they pronounced <i>happy</i> by me,
whom the storm, common <i>to all</i>, and Caphareus, swallowed up in the
threatening<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_41" id = "tag14_41" href =

then embittered as well by misfortunes, said, ‘What does there remain
now, ye men, for your patience to refuse to endure? What has Cytherea,
(supposing her to desire it), that she can do beyond this? For so long
as greater evils are dreaded, there is room for prayers; but where one’s
lot is the most wretched possible, fear is <i>trampled</i> under foot,
and the extremity <i>of misfortune</i> is free from apprehensions. Let
<i>Venus</i> herself hear it, if she likes; let her hate, as she does
<i>hate</i>, all the men under the rule of Diomedes. Yet all of us
despise her hate, and this our great power is bought by us at great
price.’</p>

<p>“With such expressions does the Pleuronian<a class = "tag" name =

Venus against her will, and revive her former anger. His words are
approved of by a few. We, the greater number of his friends, rebuke
Agmon: and as he is preparing to answer, his voice and the passage of
his voice together become diminished; his hair changes into feathers;
his neck newly formed, his breast and his back are covered with down;
his arms assume longer feathers; and his elbows curve out into light
wings. A&nbsp;great part of his foot receives toes; his mouth becomes
stiff and hardened with horn, and has its end in a point. Lycus and
Idas, and Nycteus, together with Rhetenor, and Abas, are <i>all</i>
astounded at him; and while they are astounded, they assume a similar
form; and the greater portion of my company fly off, and resound around
the oars with the flapping of their wings. Shouldst thou inquire what
was the form of these birds so suddenly made; although it was not that
of swans, yet it was approaching to that of white swans. With
difficulty, for my part, do I, the son-in-law of the Iapygian Daunus,
possess these abodes and the parched fields with a very small remnant of
my companions.”</p>

possessed it. An Apulian shepherd alarmed them, scared away from that
spot; and, at first, he terrified them with a sudden fear; afterwards,
when their presence of mind returned, and they despised him as he
followed, they formed dances, moving their feet to time. The shepherd
abused them; and imitating them with grotesque capers, he added rustic
abuse in filthy language. Nor was he silent, before the <i>growing</i>
tree closed his throat. But from this tree and its sap you may
understand <i>what</i> were his manners. For the wild olive, by its

<p class = "explanation">
Latinus having been told by an oracle that a foreign prince should come
into his country and marry his daughter Lavinia, received Æneas
hospitably, and formed an alliance with him, promising him his daughter
in marriage; on which Turnus, who was the nephew of Amata, his wife, and
to whom Lavinia was betrothed, declared war against Æneas.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The ancient historians tell us, that, on returning from the siege of
Troy, Diomedes found that his throne had been usurped by Cyllabarus, who
had married his wife Ægiale. Not having sufficient forces to dispossess
the intruder, he sought a retreat in Italy, where he built the city of
Argyripa, or Argos Hippium. Diomedes having married the daughter of
Daunus, quarrelled with his father-in-law, and was killed in fight; on
which his companions fled to an adjacent island, which, from his name,
was called Diomedea. It was afterwards reported, that on their flight
they were changed into birds, and that Venus inflicted this punishment,
in consequence of Diomedes having wounded her at the siege of Troy. Of
this story a confused version is here presented by Ovid, who makes the
transformation to take place in the lifetime of Diomedes. It is supposed
that the fact of the island being the favourite resort of swans and
herons, facilitated this story of their transformation. Pliny and
Solinus add to this marvellous account by stating, that these birds
fawned upon all Greeks who entered the island, and fled from the people
of all other nations. Ovid says that the birds resembled swans, while
other writers thought them to be herons, storks, or falcons.</p>

<p class = "explanation">

changed into a wild olive, but the story was probably derived by Ovid
from some local tradition.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Turnus</span> sets fire to the fleet of Æneas:
but Cybele transforms the ships into sea Nymphs. After the death of
Turnus, his capital, Ardea, is burnt, and a bird arises out of the
flames. Venus obtains of Jupiter that her son, after so many heroic
deeds, shall be received into the number of the Gods.</p>

<p>When the ambassador had returned thence, bringing word that the
Ætolian arms had been refused them, the Rutulians carried on the warfare
prepared for, without their forces; and much blood was shed on either
side. Lo! Turnus bears the devouring torches against the <i>ships</i>,
fabrics of pine; and those, whom the waves have spared, are <i>now</i>
in dread of fire. And now the flames were burning the pitch and the wax,
and the other elements of flame, and were mounting the lofty mast to the
sails, and the benches of the curved ships were smoking; when the holy
Mother of the Gods, remembering that these pines were cut down on the
heights of Ida, filled the air with the tinkling of the clashing cymbal,
and with the noise of the blown boxwood <i>pipe</i>. Borne through the
yielding air by her harnessed lions, she said: “Turnus, in vain dost
thou hurl the flames with thy sacrilegious right hand; I&nbsp;will save
<i>the ships</i>, and the devouring flames shall not, with my
permission, burn a portion, and the <i>very</i> limbs of my groves.”</p>

<p>As the Goddess speaks, it thunders; and following the thunder, heavy
showers fall, together with bounding hailstones; the brothers, sons of
Astræus, arouse both the air and the swelling waves with sudden
conflicts, and rush to the battle. The genial Mother, using the strength
of one of these, first bursts the hempen cables of the Phrygian fleet,
and carries the ships headlong, and buries them beneath the ocean. Their
hardness being now softened, and their wood being changed into flesh,
the crooked sterns are changed into the features of the head; the oars
taper off in fingers and swimming feet; that which has been so before,
is <i>still</i> the side; and the keel, laid below in the middle of the
ship, is changed, for the purposes of the back bone. The cordage becomes
soft hair, the yards <i>become</i> arms. Their colour is azure, as it
was before. As Naiads of the ocean, with their virgin sports they
agitate those waves, which before they dreaded; and, born on the rugged
mountains, they inhabit the flowing sea; their origin
<span class = "pagenum">505</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 558-589.</span>
influences them not. And yet, not forgetting how many dangers they
endured on the boisterous ocean, often do they give a helping hand to
the tossed ships; unless any one is carrying men of the Grecian
race.</p>

<p>Still keeping in mind the Phrygian catastrophe, they hated the
Pelasgians; and, with joyful countenances, they looked upon the
fragments of the ship of him of Neritos; and with pleasure did they see
the ship of Alcinoüs<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_46" id = "tag14_46"
href = "#note14_46">46</a> become hard upon the breakers, and stone
growing over the wood.</p>

<p>There is a hope that, the fleet having received life in the form of
sea Nymphs, the Rutulian may desist from the war through fear, on
account of this prodigy. He persists, <i>however</i>, and each side has
<i>its own</i> Deities;<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_47" id =
"tag14_47" href = "#note14_47">47</a> and they have courage, equal to
the Gods. And now they do not seek kingdoms as a dower, nor the sceptre
of a father-in-law, nor thee, virgin Lavinia, but <i>only</i> to
conquer; and they wage the war through shame at desisting. At length,
Venus sees the arms of her son victorious, and Turnus falls; Ardea
falls, which, while Turnus lived, was called ‘the mighty.’ After
ruthless flames consumed it, and its houses sank down amid the heated
embers, a&nbsp;bird, then known for the first time, flew aloft from the
midst of the heap, and beat the ashes with the flapping of its wings.
The voice, the leanness, the paleness, and every thing that befits a
captured city, and the very name of the city, remain in that
<i>bird</i>; and Ardea itself is bewailed by <i>the beating of</i> its
wings.</p>

<p>And now the merit of Æneas had obliged all the Deities, and Juno
herself, to put an end to their former resentment; when, the power of
the rising Iülus being now well established, the hero, the son of
Cytherea, was ripe for heaven, Venus, too, had solicited the Gods above;
and hanging round the neck of her parent had said: “My father, <i>who
hast</i> never <i>proved</i> unkind to me at any time, I&nbsp;beseech
thee now to be most indulgent <i>to me</i>; and to grant, dearest
<i>father</i>, to my Æneas, who, <i>born</i> of my blood, has made thee

a&nbsp;godhead, <i>even</i> though of the lowest class; so that thou
only grant him one. It is enough to have once beheld the unsightly
realms, <i>enough</i> to have once passed over the Stygian streams.” The
Gods assented; nor did his royal wife keep her countenance unmoved;
<i>but</i>, with pleased countenance, she nodded assent. Then her father
said; “You are worthy of the gift of heaven; both thou who askest, and
he, for whom thou askest: receive, my daughter, what thou dost desire.”
<i>Thus</i> he decrees. She rejoices, and gives thanks to her parent;
and, borne by her harnessed doves through the light air, she arrives at
the Laurentine shores; where Numicius,<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_48"

ocean in his silent course.</p>

<p>The horned <i>river</i> performed the commands of Venus; and with his

His superior essence remained. His mother anointed his body <i>thus</i>

founded on a very simple fact. It is merely a poetical method of
accounting for the Latin name of that bird, which was very plentiful in
the vicinity of the city of Ardea, and, perhaps, thence derived its name
of ‘ardea.’ The story may have been the more readily suggested to the
punning mind of Ovid, from the resemblance of the Latin verb ‘ardeo,’
signifying ‘to burn,’ to that name.</p>

Some of the ancient authors say, that after killing Turnus and marrying
Lavinia, Æneas was killed in battle with Mezentius, after a reign of
three years, leaving his wife pregnant with a son, afterwards known by
the name of Sylvius. His body not being found after the battle, it was
given out that his Goddess mother had translated him to heaven, and he
was thenceforth honoured by the name of Jupiter Indiges.</p>

Capys was the first <i>of these</i>. Tiberinus received the sovereignty

<span class = "linenum">xiv. 624-656.</span>
the Hamadryads of Latium more skilfully tended her gardens, and no one
was more attentive to the produce of the trees; thence she derives her
name. She <i>cares</i> not <i>for</i> woods, or streams; <i>but</i> she
loves the country, and the boughs that bear the thriving fruit. Her
right hand is not weighed down with a javelin, but with a curved
pruning-knife, with which, at one time she crops the <i>too</i>
luxuriant shoots, and reduces the branches that straggle without order;
at another time, she is engrafting the sucker in the divided bark, and
is <i>so</i> finding nourishment for a stranger nursling. Nor does she
suffer them to endure thirst; she waters, too, the winding fibres of the
twisting root with the flowing waters. This is her delight, this her
pursuit; and no desire has she for love. But fearing the violence of the
rustics, she closes her orchard within <i>a&nbsp;wall</i>, and both
forbids and flies from the approach of males.</p>

<p>What did not the Satyrs do, a youthful crew expert at the dance, and
the Pans with their brows wreathed with pine, and Sylvanus, ever more
youthful than his years, and the God who scares the thieves either with
his pruning-hook or with his groin, in order that they might gain her?
But yet Vertumnus exceeded even these in his love, nor was he more
fortunate than the rest. O! how often did he carry the ears of corn in a
basket, under the guise of a hardy reaper; and he was the very picture
of a reaper! Many a time, having his temples bound with fresh bay, he
would appear to have been turning over the mowed grass. He often bore a
whip in his sturdy hand, so that you would have sworn that he had that
instant been unyoking the wearied oxen. A&nbsp;pruning-knife being given
him, he was a woodman, and the pruner of the vine. <i>Now</i> he was
carrying a ladder, <i>and</i> you would suppose he was going to gather
fruit. <i>Sometimes</i> he was a soldier, with a sword, <i>and
sometimes</i> a fisherman, taking up the rod; in fact, by means of many

kisses, such as no real old woman <i>ever</i> could have given; and
stooping, seated himself upon the grass, looking up at the branches
bending under the load of autumn. There was an elm opposite, widely
spread with swelling grapes; after he had praised it, together with the

me as a surety <i>for him</i>. He is not better known, even to himself,

throughout all the world; these spots only does he frequent; and he does
not, like a great part of thy wooers, fall in love with her whom he sees

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
Among the Deities borrowed by the Romans from the people of Etruria,
were Vertumnus and Pomona, who presided over gardens and fruits.
Propertius represents Vertumnus as rejoicing at having left Tusculum for
the Roman Forum. According to Varro and Festus, the Romans offered
sacrifices to these Deities, and they had their respective temples and
altars at Rome, the priest of Pomona being called ‘Flamen Pomonalis.’ It
is probable that this story originated in the fancy of the Poet.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The name of Vertumnus, from ‘verto,’ ‘to change,’ perhaps relates to the
vicissitudes of the seasons; and if this story refers to any tradition,
its meaning may have been, that in his taking various forms, to please
Pomona, the change of seasons requisite for bringing the fruits to
ripeness was symbolized. It is possible that in the disguises of a
labourer, a&nbsp;reaper, and an old woman, the Poet may intend to
pourtray the spring, the harvest, and the winter.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
There was a market at Rome, near the temple of this God, who was
regarded as one of the tutelary Deities of the traders. Horace alludes
to his temple which was in the Vicus Tuscus, or Etrurian Street, which
led to the Circus Maximus. According to some authors, he was an ancient
king of Etruria, who paid great attention to his gardens, and, after his
death, was considered to have the tutelage of them.</p>

<p class = "synopsis">Vertumnus relates to Pomona how Anaxarete was
changed into a rock after her disdain of his advances had forced her
lover Iphis to hang himself. After the death of Amulius and Numitor,
Romulus builds Rome, and becomes the first king of it. Tatius declares
war against him, and is favoured by Juno, while Venus protects the
Romans.

Romulus and Hersilia are added to the number of the Deities, under the
names of Quirinus and Ora.</p>


<p>Iphis, born of an humble family, had beheld the noble Anaxarete,
sprung from the race of the ancient Teucer;<a class = "tag" name =
"tag14_56" id = "tag14_56" href = "#note14_56">56</a> he had seen her,
and had felt the flame in all his bones; and struggling a long time,
when he could not subdue his passion by reason, he came suppliantly to
her doors. And now having confessed to her nurse his unfortunate
passion, he besought her, by the hopes <i>she reposed</i> in her
nursling, not to be hard-hearted to him; and at another time,
complimenting each of the numerous servants, he besought their kind
interest with an anxious voice. He often gave his words to be borne on
the flattering tablets; sometimes he fastened garlands, wet with the dew
of his tears, upon the door-posts, and laid his tender side upon the
hard threshold, and uttered reproaches against the obdurate bolt.</p>

<p>She, more deaf than the sea, swelling when <i>the Constellation
of</i> the Kids is setting, and harder than the iron which the Norican
fire<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_57" id = "tag14_57" href =
"#note14_57">57</a> refines, and than the rock which in its native state
is yet held fast by the firm roots, despises, and laughs at him; and to
her cruel deeds, in her pride, she adds boastful words, and deprives her
lover of even hope. Iphis, unable to endure this prolonged pain, endured
his torments no <i>longer</i>; and before her doors he spoke these words
as his last: “Thou art the conquerer, Anaxarete; and no more annoyances
wilt thou have to bear from me. Prepare the joyous triumph, invoke the
God Pæan, and crown thyself with the shining laurel. For thou art the
conqueror, and of my own will I die; do thou, <i>woman</i> of iron,
rejoice. At least, thou wilt be obliged to commend something in me, and
there will be one point in which I shall be pleasing to thee, and thou
wilt confess my merits. Yet remember that my affection for thee has not
ended sooner than my life; and that at the same moment I am about to be
deprived of a twofold light. And report shall not come to thee as the
<span class = "pagenum">512</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 726-753.</span>
messenger of my death; I&nbsp;myself will come, doubt it not; and I
myself will be seen in person, that thou mayst satiate thy cruel eyes
with my lifeless body. But if, ye Gods above, you take cognizance of the
fortunes of mortals, be mindful of me; beyond this, my tongue is unable
to pray; and cause me to be remembered in times far distant; and give
those hours to Fame which you have taken away from my existence.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> he said; and raising his swimming eyes and his pallid
arms to the door-posts, so often adorned by him with wreaths, when he
had fastened a noose at the end of a halter upon the door; he
said,&mdash; “Are these the garlands that delight thee, cruel and
unnatural <i>woman</i>?” And he placed his head within it; but even then
he was turned towards her; and he hung a hapless burden, by his
strangled throat. The door, struck by the motion of his feet as they
quivered, seemed to utter a sound, as <i>of one</i> groaning much, and
flying open, it discovered the deed; the servants cried aloud, and after
lifting him up in vain, they carried him to the house of his mother (for
his father was dead). She received him into her bosom; and embracing the
cold limbs of her child, after she had uttered the words that are
<i>natural</i> to wretched mothers, and had performed the <i>usual</i>
actions of wretched mothers, she was preceding<a class = "tag" name =
"tag14_58" id = "tag14_58" href = "#note14_58">58</a> the tearful
funeral through the midst of the city, and was carrying his ghastly
corpse on the bier, to be committed to the flames.</p>

<p>By chance, her house was near the road where the mournful procession
was passing, and the sound of lamentation came to the ears of the
hardhearted Anaxarete, whom now an avenging Deity pursued. Moved,
however, she said:&mdash; “Let us behold these sad obsequies;” and she
ascended to an upper room<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_59" id =
"tag14_59" href = "#note14_59">59</a> with wide windows. And scarce had
she well
<span class = "pagenum">513</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 753-785.</span>
seen Iphis laid out on the bier, <i>when</i> her eyes became stiffened,
and a paleness coming on, the warm blood fled from her body. And as she
endeavoured to turn her steps back again, she stood fixed <i>there</i>;
and as she endeavoured to turn away her face, this too she was unable to
do; and by degrees the stone, which already existed in her cruel breast,
took possession of her limbs.</p>

<p>“And, that thou mayst not think this a fiction, Salamis still keeps
the statue under the form of the maiden; it has also a temple under the
name of ‘Venus, the looker-out.’ Remembering these things, O&nbsp;Nymph,
lay aside this prolonged disdain, and unite thyself to one who loves
thee. Then, may neither cold in the spring nip thy fruit in the bud, nor
may the rude winds strike them off in blossom.” When the God, fitted for
every shape, had in vain uttered these words, he returned to his
youthful form,<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_60" id = "tag14_60" href =
"#note14_60">60</a> and took off from himself the garb of the old woman.
And such did he appear to her, as, when the form of the sun, in all his
brilliancy, has dispelled the opposing clouds, and has shone forth, no
cloud intercepting <i>his rays</i>. And he <i>now</i> purposed violence,
but there was no need for force, and the Nymph was captivated by the
form of the God, and was sensible of a reciprocal wound.</p>

<p>Next, the soldiery of the wicked Amulius held sway over the realms of
Ausonia; and by the aid of his grandsons, the aged Numitor gained the
kingdom that he had lost; and on the festival of Pales, the walls of the
City were founded. Tatius and the Sabine fathers waged war; and
<i>then</i>, the way to the citadel being laid open, by a just
retribution, Tarpeia lost her life, the arms being heaped <i>upon
her</i>. On this, they, sprung from <i>the town of</i> Cures, just like
silent wolves, suppressed their voices with their lips, and fell upon
the bodies <i>now</i> overpowered by sleep, and rushed to the gates,
which the son of Ilia had shut with a strong bolt. But <i>Juno</i>, the
daughter of Saturn, herself opened one, and made not a sound at the
turning of the hinge. Venus alone perceived that the bars of the gate
had fallen down; and she would have shut it, were it not, that it is
<span class = "pagenum">514</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 785-820.</span>
never allowed for a Deity to annul the acts of the <i>other</i> Gods.
The Naiads of Ausonia occupied a spot near <i>the temple of</i> Janus,
<i>a&nbsp;place</i> besprinkled by a cold fountain; of these she
implored aid. Nor did the Nymphs resist, the Goddess making so fair a
request; and they gave vent to the springs and the streams of the
fountain. But not yet were the paths closed to the open <i>temple of</i>
Janus, and the water had not stopped the way. They placed sulphur, with
its faint blue light, beneath the plenteous fountain, and they applied
fire to the hollowed channels, with smoking pitch.</p>

<p>By these and other violent means, the vapour penetrated to the very
sources of the fountain; and <i>you</i>, ye waters, which, so lately,
were able to rival the coldness of the Alps, yielded not <i>in heat</i>
to the flames themselves. The two door-posts smoked with the flaming
spray; and the gate, which was in vain left open for the fierce Sabines,
was rendered impassable by this new-made fountain, until the warlike
soldiers had assumed their arms. After Romulus had readily led them
onward, and the Roman ground was covered with Sabine bodies, and was
covered with its own <i>people,</i> and the accursed sword had mingled
the blood of the son-in-law with the gore of the father-in-law; they
determined that the war should end in peace, and that they would not
contend with weapons to the last extremity, and that Tatius should share
in the sovereignty.</p>

<p>Tatius was <i>now</i> dead, and thou, Romulus, wast giving laws in
common to both peoples; when Mavors,<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_61"
id = "tag14_61" href = "#note14_61">61</a> his helmet laid aside, in
such words as these addressed the Parent of both Gods and men: “The time
is <i>now</i> come, O&nbsp;father, (since the Roman state is established
on a strong foundation, and is no longer dependent on the guardianship
of but one), for thee to give the reward which was promised to me, and
to thy grandson <i>so</i> deserving of it, and, removed from earth, to
admit him to heaven. Thou saidst to me once, a&nbsp;council of the Gods
being present, (for I remember it, and with grateful mind I remarked the
affectionate speech), he shall be one, whom thou shalt raise to the
azure heaven. Let the tenor of thy words be <i>now</i> performed.”</p>

<p>The all-powerful <i>God</i> nodded in assent, and he obscured the air
with thick clouds, and alarmed the City with thunder and lightning.
Gradivus knew that this was a signal given to
<span class = "pagenum">515</span>
<span class = "linenum">xiv. 820-848.</span>
him for the promised removal; and, leaning on his lance, he boldly
mounted <i>behind</i> his steeds, laden with the blood-stained pole
<i>of the chariot</i>, and urged them on with the lash of the whip; and
descending along the steep air, he stood on the summit of the hill of
the woody Palatium; and he took away the son of Ilia, that moment giving
out his royal ordinances to his own Quirites. His mortal body glided
through the yielding air; just as the leaden plummet, discharged from
the broad sling, is wont to dissolve itself<a class = "tag" name =
"tag14_62" id = "tag14_62" href = "#note14_62">62</a> in mid air.
A&nbsp;beauteous appearance succeeded, one more suitable to the lofty
couches<a class = "tag" name = "tag14_63" id = "tag14_63" href =
"#note14_63">63</a> of heaven, and a form, such as that of Quirinus
arrayed in his regal robe. His wife was lamenting him as lost; when the
royal Juno commanded Iris to descend to Hersilia, along her bending
path; and thus to convey to the bereft <i>wife</i> her
commands:&mdash;</p>

<p>“O matron, the especial glory of the Latian and of the Sabine race;
thou woman, most worthy to have been before the wife of a hero so great,
<i>and</i> now of Quirinus; cease thy weeping, and if thou hast a wish
to see thy husband, under my guidance repair to the grove which
flourishes on the hill of Quirinus, and overshadows the temple of the
Roman king.” Iris obeys, and gliding down to earth along her tinted bow,
she addressed Hersilia in the words enjoined. She, with a modest
countenance, hardly raising her eyes, replies, “O&nbsp;Goddess, (for
<i>though</i> it is not in my power to say who thou art, <i>yet</i>,
still it is clear that thou art a Goddess), lead me, O&nbsp;lead me on,
and present to me the features of my husband. If the Fates should but
allow me to be enabled once to behold these, I&nbsp;will confess that I
have beheld Heaven.”</p>

<p>There was no delay; with the virgin daughter of Thaumas she ascended
the hill of Romulus. There, a&nbsp;star falling from the skies, fell
upon the earth; the hair of Hersilia set on fire from the blaze of this,
ascended with the star to the skies.

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
We are not informed that the story of Iphis, hanging himself for love of
Anaxarete, is based upon any actual occurrence, though probably it was,
as Salamis is mentioned as the scene of it. The transformation of
Anaxarete into a stone, seems only to be the usual metaphor employed by
the poets to denote extreme insensibility.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Following the example of Homer, who represents the Gods as divided into
the favourers of the Greeks and of the Trojans, he represents the
Sabines as entering Rome, while Juno opens the gates for them; on which
the Nymphs of the spot pour forth streams of flame, which oblige them to
return. He tells the same story in the first Book of the Fasti, where
Janus is introduced as taking credit to himself for doing what the
Nymphs are here said to have effected.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
As Dionysius of Halicarnassus gives some account of these transactions,
on the authority of the ancient Roman historians, it will be sufficient
here to give the substance thereof. Jealous of the increasing power of
Romulus, the Sabines collected an army, and marched to attack his city.
A&nbsp;virgin named Tarpeia, whose father commanded the guard,
perceiving the golden bracelets which the Sabines wore on their arms,
offered Tatius to open the gate to him, if he would give her these
jewels. This condition being assented to, the enemy was admitted into
the town; and Tarpeia, who is said by some writers only to have intended
to disarm the Sabines, by demanding their bucklers, which she pretended
were included in the original agreement, was killed on the spot, by the
violence of the blows; Tatius having ordered that they should be thrown
on her head.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The same historian says, that opinions were divided as to the death of
Romulus, and that many writers had written, that as he was haranguing
his army, the sky became overcast, and a thick darkness coming on, it
was followed by a violent tempest, in which he disappeared; on which it
was believed that Mars had taken him up to heaven. Others assert that he
was killed by the citizens, for having sent back the hostages of the
Veientes without their consent, and for assuming an air of superiority,
which their lawless spirits could ill brook. For these reasons, his
officers assassinated him, and cut his body in pieces; each of them
carrying off some portion, that it might be privately interred.
According to Livy, great consternation was the consequence of his death;
and the people beginning to suspect that the senators had committed the
crime, Julius Proculus asserted that Romulus had appeared to him, and
assured him of the fact of his having been Deified. His speech on the
occasion is given by Livy, and Ovid relates the same story in the second
Book of the Fasti. On this, the Roman people paid him divine honours as
a God, under the name of Quirinus, one of the epithets of Mars. He had a
chief priest, who was called ‘Flamen Quirinalis.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
His wife, Hersilia, also had divine honours paid to her, jointly with
him, under the name of Ora, or ‘Horta.’ According to Plutarch, she had
the latter name from the exhortation which she had given to the youths
to distinguish themselves by courage.</p>

<i>Inarime.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 89. This was an island not far from the
coast of Campania, which was also called Ischia and Ænaria. The word
‘Inarime’ is thought to have been coined by Virgil, from the expression
of Homer, <span class = "greek" title = "ein Arimois">εῖν
Ἀρίμοις</span>, when speaking of it, as that writer is the first who is
found to use it, and is followed by Ovid, Lucan, and others. Strabo
tells us, that ‘aremus’ was the Etrurian name for an ape; if so, the
name of this spot may account for the name of Pithecusæ, the adjoining
islands, if the tradition here related by the Poet really existed. Pliny
the Elder, however, says that Pithecusæ were so called from <span class
= "greek" title = "pithos">πίθος</span>, an earthern cask, or vessel, as
there were many potteries there.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_10" id = "note14_10" href = "#tag14_10">10.</a>
<i>Prochyta.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 89. This island was said to have been torn
away from the isle of Inarime by an earthquake; for which reason it
received its name from the Greek verb <span class = "greek" title =
"procheô">προχέω</span>, which means ‘to pour forth.’</p>

<i>Long-lived Sibyl.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 104. The Sibyls were said by some
to have their name from the fact of their revealing the will of the
Deities, as in the Æolian dialect, <span class = "greek" title =
"Sios">Σιὸς</span> was ‘a God,’ and <span class = "greek" title =
"boulê">βουλὴ</span> was the Greek for ‘will.’ According to other
writers, they were so called from <span class = "greek" title = "Siou bullê">Σίου βύλλη</span>, ‘full of the Deity.’</p>

<p><a name = "note14_19" id = "note14_19" href = "#tag14_19">19.</a>
<i>Nearly causing.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 181. Homer, in the Ninth Book of the
Odyssey, recounts how Ulysses, after having put out the eye of
Polyphemus, fled to his own ship, and when the Giant followed, called
out to him, disclosing his real name; whereas, he had before told the
Cyclop that his name was <span class = "greek" title =
"outis">οὔτις</span>, ‘nobody.’ By this indiscreet action, the Cyclop
was able to ascertain the locality of the ship, and nearly sank it with
a mass of rock which he hurled in that direction.</p>

<i>Become attached.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 304-5. ‘Subjecta lacertis Brachia
sunt,’ Clarke has not a very lucid translation of these words. His
version is, ‘Brachia are put under our lacerti.’ The ‘brachium’ was the
forearm, or part, from the wrist to the elbow; while the ‘lacertus’ was
the muscular part, between the elbow and the shoulder.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_28" id = "note14_28" href = "#tag14_28">28.</a>

it is hollow, and if there are any insects beneath it.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_36" id = "note14_36" href = "#tag14_36">36.</a>
<i>Tartessian shores.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 416. ‘Tartessia’ is here used as a
general term for Western, as Tartessus was a city of the Western coast
of Spain. It afterwards had the name of Carteia, and is thought to have
been situated not far from the site of the present Cadiz, at the mouth
of the Bætis, now called the Guadalquivir. Some suppose this name to be
the same with the Tarshish of Scripture.</p>

<i>Narycian hero.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 468. Naryx, which was also called
Narycium and Naryce, was a city of Locris. He alludes to the divine
vengeance which punished Ajax Oïleus, who had ravished Cassandra in the
temple of Minerva. For this reason the Greeks were said to have been
afflicted with shipwreck, on their return after the destruction of
Troy.</p>

the city of Calydon, in his native Ætolia.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_44" id = "note14_44" href = "#tag14_44">44.</a>
<i>Peucetian.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 513. Apulia was divided by the river
Aufidus into two parts, Peucetia and Daunia. Peucetia was to the East,
and Daunia lay to the West. According to Antoninus Liberalis, Daunus,
Iapyx, and Peucetius, the sons of Lycaon, were the first to colonize
these parts.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_46" id = "note14_46" href = "#tag14_46">46.</a>
<i>Ship of Alcinoüs.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 565. Alcinoüs, the king of the
Phæacians, having saved Ulysses from shipwreck, gave him a ship in which
to return to Ithaca. Neptune, to revenge the injuries of his son
Polyphemus, changed the ship into a rock.</p>

<i>Numicius.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 599. Livy, in the first Book of his
History, seems to say that Æneas lost his life in a battle, fought near
the Numicius, a&nbsp;river of Latium. He is generally supposed to have
been drowned there.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_49" id = "note14_49" href = "#tag14_49">49.</a>
<i>Indiges.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 608. Cicero says, that ‘those, who for their
merits were reckoned in the number of the Gods, and who formerly living
on earth, and afterwards lived among the Gods (in Diis agerent), were
called Indigetes;’ thus implying that the word ‘Indiges’ came from ‘in
Diis ago;’ ‘to live among the Gods.’ This seems a rather far-fetched
derivation. The true meaning of the word seems to be ‘native,’ or
‘indigenous;’ and it applies to a person Deified, and considered as a
tutelary Deity of his native country. Most probably, it is derived from
‘in,’ or ‘indu,’ the old Latin form of ‘in,’ and <span class = "greek"
title = "geinô">γείνω</span> (for <span class = "greek" title =
"ginomai">γίνομαι</span>), ‘to be born.’ Some would derive the word from
‘in,’ negative, and ‘ago,’ to speak, as signifying Deities, whose names
were not be mentioned.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_52" id = "note14_52" href = "#tag14_52">52.</a>
<i>By the stroke.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 618. Possibly both Remulus (if there
ever was such a person) and Tullus Hostilius may have fallen victims to
some electrical experiments which they were making; this may have given
rise to the story that they had been struck with lightning for imitating
the prerogative of Jupiter.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_53" id = "note14_53" href = "#tag14_53">53.</a>
<i>A coloured cap.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 654. ‘Pictâ redimitus tempora mitrâ,’
is rendered by Clarke, ‘Having his temples wrapped up in a painted
bonnet.’ The ‘mitra,’ which was worn on the head by females, was a broad
cloth band of various colours. The use of it was derived from the
Eastern nations, and, probably, it was very similar to our turban. It
was much used by the Phrygians, and in later times among the Greeks and
Romans. It is supposed that it was worn in a broad fillet round the
head, and was tied under the chin with bands. When Clodius went
disguised in female apparel to the rites of Bona Dea, he wore a
‘mitra.’</p>

<p><a name = "note14_54" id = "note14_54" href = "#tag14_54">54.</a>
<i>Stood unwedded.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 663. Ovid probably derived this
notion from the language of the Roman husbandmen. Columella and other
writers on agricultural matters often make mention of a ‘maritus ulmus,’
and a ‘nupta vitis,’ in contradistinction to those trees which stood by
themselves.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_56" id = "note14_56" href = "#tag14_56">56.</a>
<i>Ancient Teucer.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 698. When Teucer returned home after
the Trojan war, his father Telamon banished him, for not having revenged
the death of his brother Ajax, which was imputed to Ulysses, as having
been the occasion of it, by depriving him of the armour of Achilles.
Thus exiled, he fled to Cyprus, where he founded the city of
Salamis.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_57" id = "note14_57" href = "#tag14_57">57.</a>
<i>Norican fire.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 712. Noricum was a district of Germany,
between the Danube and the Alps. It is still famous for its excellent
steel; the goodness of which, Pliny attributes partly to the superior
quality of the ore, and partly to the temperature of the climate.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_58" id = "note14_58" href = "#tag14_58">58.</a>
<i>She was preceding.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 746. It was customary for the
relations, both male and female, to attend the body to the tomb or the
funeral pile. Among the Greeks, the male relatives walked in front of
the body, preceded by the head mourners, while the female relations
walked behind. Among the Romans, all the relations walked behind the
corpse; the males having their heads veiled, and the females with their
heads bare and hair dishevelled, contrary to the usual practice of each
sex.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_59" id = "note14_59" href = "#tag14_59">59.</a>
<i>An upper room.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 752. Anaxarete went to an upper room,
to look out into the street, as the apartments on the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘grouud’">ground</ins> floor were
rarely lighted with windows. The principal apartments on the ground
floor received their light from above, and the smaller rooms there,
usually derived their light from the larger ones; while on the other
hand, the rooms on the upper floor were usually lighted with windows.
The conduct of Anaxarete reminds us of that of Marcella, the hardhearted
shepherdess, which so aroused the indignation of the amiable, but
unfortunate, Don Quixotte.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_60" id = "note14_60" href = "#tag14_60">60.</a>
<i>His youthful form.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 766-7. ‘In juvenem rediit: et
anilia demit Instrumenta sibi.’ These words are thus translated by
Clarke: ‘He returned into a young fellow, and takes off his old woman’s
accoutrements from him.’ We hear of the accoutrements of a cavalry
officer much more frequently than we do those of an old woman.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_61" id = "note14_61" href = "#tag14_61">61.</a>
<i>Mavors.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 806. Mavors, which is often used by the poets
as a name of Mars, probably gave rise to the latter name as a contracted
form of it.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_62" id = "note14_62" href = "#tag14_62">62.</a>
<i>To dissolve itself.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 826. Not only, as we have already
remarked, was it a notion among the ancients that the leaden plummet
thrown from the sling grew red hot; but they occasionally went still
further, and asserted that, from the rapidity of the motion, it melted
and disappeared altogether. See note to Book II. l. 727.</p>

<p><a name = "note14_63" id = "note14_63" href = "#tag14_63">63.</a>
<i>Lofty couches.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 827. The ‘pulvinaria’ were the
cushions, or couches, placed in the temples of the Gods, for the use of
the Divinities; which probably their priests (like their brethren who
administered to Bel) did not omit to enjoy. At the festivals of the
‘lectisternia,’ the statues of the Gods were placed upon these cushions.
The images of the Deities in the Roman Circus, were also placed on a
‘pulvinar.’</p>

he builds the city of Crotona.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one is being sought who can bear a weight of such
magnitude, and can succeed a king so great. Fame, the harbinger of
truth, destines the illustrious Numa for the sovereign power. He does
not deem it sufficient to be acquainted with the ceremonials of the
Sabine nation; in his expansive mind he conceives greater views, and
inquires into the nature of things. ’Twas love of this pursuit, his
country and cares left behind, that caused him to penetrate to the city
of the stranger Hercules. To him, making the inquiry what founder it was
that had erected a Grecian city on the Italian shores, one of the more
aged natives, who was not unacquainted with <i>the history of</i> the
past, thus replied:</p>

<p>“The son of Jove, enriched with the oxen of Iberia, is said to have
reached the Lacinian shores,<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_1" id =
"tag15_1" href = "#note15_1">1</a> from the ocean, after a prosperous
voyage, and, while his herd was straying along the soft pastures,
himself to have entered the abode of the great Croton, no inhospitable
dwelling, and to have rested in repose after his prolonged labours, and
to have said thus at departing: ‘In the time of thy grandsons this shall
be the site of a city;’ and his promise was fulfilled. For there was a
certain Myscelos, the son of Alemon, an Argive, most favoured by the
Gods in those times. Lying upon him, as he is overwhelmed with the
drowsiness of sleep, the club-bearer, <i>Hercules</i>, addresses him:
‘Come, <i>now</i>, desert thy native abodes; go, <i>and</i> repair to
the pebbly streams of the distant Æsar.’<a class = "tag" name =
"tag15_2" id = "tag15_2" href = "#note15_2">2</a> And he utters
<span class = "pagenum">518</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 24-52.</span>
threats, many and fearful, if he does not obey: after that, at once both
sleep and the God depart. The son of Alemon arises, and ponders his
recent vision in his thoughtful mind; and for a long time his opinions
are divided among themselves. The Deity orders him to depart; the laws
forbid his going; and death has been awarded as the punishment of him
who attempts to leave his country.</p>

<p>“The brilliant Sun had <i>now</i> hidden his shining head in the
ocean, and darkest Night had put forth her starry face, <i>when</i> the
same God seemed to be present, and to give the same commands, and to
utter threats, more numerous and more severe, if he does not obey. He
was alarmed; and <i>now</i> he was also preparing to transfer his
country’s home to a new settlement, <i>when</i> a rumour arose in the
city, and he was accused of holding the laws in contempt. And, when the
accusation had first been made, and his crime was evident, proved
without a witness, the accused, in neglected garb, raising his face and
his hands towards the Gods above, says, ‘Oh thou! for whom the twice six
labours have created the privilege of the heavens, aid me, I&nbsp;pray;
for thou wast the cause of my offence.’ It was the ancient custom, by
means of white and black pebbles, with the one to condemn the accused,
with the other to acquit them of the charge; and on this occasion thus
was the sad sentence passed, and every black pebble was cast into the
ruthless urn. Soon as it, being inverted, poured forth the pebbles to be
counted, the colour of them all was changed from black to white, and the
sentence, changed to a favourable one by the aid of Hercules, acquitted
the son of Alemon.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
To the story here told of Micylus, or Myscelus, as most of the ancient
writers call him, another one was superadded. Suidas, on the authority
of the Scholiast of Aristophanes, says that Myscelus, having consulted
the oracle, concerning the colony which he was about to lead into a
foreign country, was told that he must settle at the place where he
should meet with rain in a clear sky, <span class = "greek" title = "ex aithrias">ἐξ αἰθρίας</span>. His faith surmounting the apparent
impossibility of having both fair and foul weather at the same moment,
he obeyed the oracle, and put to sea; and, after experiencing many
dangers, he landed in Italy. Being full of uncertainty where to fix his
colony, he was reduced to great distress; on which his wife, whose name
was Aithrias, with the view of comforting him, embraced him, and bedewed
his face with her tears. He immediately adopted the presage, and
understood the spot where he then was to be the site of his intended
city.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Strabo says that Myscelus, who was so called from the smallness of his
legs, designing to found a colony in a foreign land, arrived on the
coast of Italy. Observing that the spot which the oracle had pointed out
enjoyed a healthy climate, though the soil was not so fertile as in the
adjacent plains, he went once more to consult the oracle; but was
answered that he must not refuse what was offered him; an answer which
was afterwards turned into a proverb. On this, he founded the city of
Crotona, and another colony founded the city of Sybaris on the spot
which he had preferred; a&nbsp;place which afterwards became infamous
for its voluptuousness and profligacy.</p>

<p>There was a man, a Samian by birth; but he had fled from both Samos
and its rulers,<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_8" id = "tag15_8" href =
"#note15_8">8</a> and, through hatred of tyranny,
<span class = "pagenum">520</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 60-98.</span>
he was a voluntary exile. He too, mentally, held converse with the Gods,
although far distant in the region of the heavens; and what nature
refused to human vision, he viewed with the eyes of his mind. And when
he had examined all things with his mind, and with watchful study, he
gave them to be learned by the public; and he sought the crowds of
people <i>as they sat</i> in silence, and wondered at the revealed
origin of the vast universe, and the cause of things, and what nature
<i>meant</i>, and what was God; whence <i>came</i> the snow, what was
the cause of lightning; <i>whether it was</i> Jupiter, or whether the
winds that thundered when the cloud was rent asunder; what it was that
shook the earth; by what laws the stars took their course; and whatever
<i>besides</i> lay concealed <i>from mortals</i>.</p>

<p>He, too, was the first to forbid animals to be served up at table,
and he was the first that opened his lips, learned indeed, but still not
obtaining credit, in such words as these: “Forbear, mortals, to pollute
your bodies with <i>such</i> abominable food. There is the corn; there
are the apples that bear down the branches by their weight, and <i>there
are</i> the grapes swelling upon the vines; there are the herbs that are
pleasant; there are some that can become tender, and be softened by
<i>the action of</i> fire. The flowing milk, too, is not denied you, nor
honey redolent of the bloom of the thyme. The lavish Earth yields her
riches, and her <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">agreable</ins> food, and affords dainties without slaughter
and bloodshed. The beasts satisfy their hunger with flesh; and yet not
all of them; for the horse, and the sheep, and the herds subsist on
grass. But those whose disposition is cruel and fierce, the Armenian
tigers, and the raging lions, and the bears together with the wolves,
revel in their diet with blood. Alas! what a crime is it, for entrails
to be buried in entrails, and for one ravening body to grow fat on
<i>other</i> carcases crammed <i>into</i> it; and for one living
creature to exist through the death of another living creature! And
does, forsooth! amid so great an abundance, which the earth, that best
of mothers, produces, nothing delight you but to gnaw with savage teeth
the sad <i>produce of your</i> wounds, and to revive the habits of the
Cyclops? And can you not appease the hunger of a voracious and
ill-regulated stomach unless you first destroy another? But that age of
old, to which we have given the name of ‘Golden,’ was blest in the
<span class = "pagenum">521</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 98-131.</span>
produce of the trees, and in the herbs which the earth produces, and it
did not pollute the mouth with blood.</p>

<p>“Then, both did the birds move their wings in safety in the air, and
the hare without fear wander in the midst of the fields; then its own
credulity had not suspended the fish from the hook; every place was
without treachery, and in dread of no injury, and was full of peace.
Afterwards, <i>some one</i>, no good adviser<a class = "tag" name =
"tag15_9" id = "tag15_9" href = "#note15_9">9</a> (whoever among mortals
he might have been), envied this simple food, and engulphed in his
greedy paunch victuals made from a carcase; ’twas he that opened the
path to wickedness; and I can believe that the steel, <i>since</i>
stained with blood, first grew warm from the slaughter of wild beasts.
And that had been sufficient. I&nbsp;confess that the bodies <i>of
animals</i> that seek our destruction are put to death with no breach of
the sacred laws; but, although they might be put to death, yet they were
not to be eaten as well. Then this wickedness proceeded still further;
and the swine is believed to have deserved death as the first victim,
because it grubbed up the seeds with its turned-up snout, and cut short
the hopes of the year. Having gnawed the vine, the goat was led<ins
class = "correction" title = "footnote tag missing"><a class = "tag"
name = "tag15_10" id = "tag15_10" href = "#note15_10">10</a></ins> for
slaughter to the altars of the avenging Bacchus. Their own faults were
the ruin of the two. But why have you deserved this, ye sheep?
a&nbsp;harmless breed, and born for the service of man; who carry the
nectar in your full udders; who afford your wool as soft coverings for
us, and who assist us more by your life than by your death. Why have the
oxen deserved this, an animal without guile and deceit, innocent,
harmless, born to endure labour? In fact, the man is ungrateful, and not
worthy of the gifts of the harvest, who could, just after taking off the
weight of the curving plough, slaughter the tiller of his fields; who
could strike, with the axe, that neck worn bare with labour, through
which he had so oft turned up the hard ground, <i>and</i> had afforded
so many a harvest.</p>

<p>“And it is not enough for such wickedness to be committed; they have
imputed to the Gods themselves this abomination; and they believe that a
Deity in the heavens can rejoice in the slaughter of the laborious ox.
A&nbsp;victim free from a blemish, and most beauteous in form (for ’tis
being sightly that
<span class = "pagenum">522</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 131-162.</span>
brings destruction), adorned with garlands and gold, is placed upon the
altars, and, in its ignorance, it hears one praying, and sees the corn,
which it has helped to produce, placed on its forehead between its
horns; and, felled, it stains with its blood the knives perhaps before
seen by it in the limpid water. Immediately, they examine the entrails
snatched from its throbbing breast, and in them they seek out the
intentions of the Deities. Whence comes it that men have so great a
hankering for forbidden food? Do you presume to feed <i>on flesh</i>,
O&nbsp;race of mortals? Do it not, I&nbsp;beseech you; and give
attention to my exhortations. And when you shall be presenting the limbs
of slaughtered oxen to your palates, know and consider that you are
devouring your <i>tillers of the ground</i>. And since a God impels me
to speak, I&nbsp;will duly obey the God that <i>so</i> prompts me to
speak; and I will pronounce my own Delphic <i>warnings</i>, and disclose
the heavens themselves; and I will reveal the oracles of the Divine
will. I&nbsp;will sing of wondrous things, never investigated by the
intellects of the ancients, and <i>things</i> which have long lain
concealed. It delights me to range among the lofty stars; it delights
me, having left the earth and this sluggish spot <i>far behind</i>, to
be borne amid the clouds, and to be supported on the shoulders of the
mighty Atlas; and to look down from afar on minds wandering <i>in
uncertainty</i>, and devoid of reason; and so to advise them alarmed and
dreading extinction, and to unfold the range of things ordained by
fate.</p>

<p>“O race! stricken by the alarms of icy death, why do you dread Styx?
why the shades, why empty names, the stock subjects of the poets, and
the atonements of an imaginary world? Whether the funeral pile consumes
your bodies with flames, or old age with gradual dissolution, believe
that they cannot suffer any injury. Souls are not subject to death; and
having left their former abode, they ever inhabit new dwellings, and,
<i>there</i> received, live&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>“I, myself, for I remember it, in the days of the Trojan war, was
Euphorbus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_11" id = "tag15_11" href =
"#note15_11">11</a> the son of Panthoüs, in whose opposing
<span class = "pagenum">523</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 162-195.</span>
breast once was planted the heavy spear of the younger son of Atreus.
I&nbsp;lately recognised the shield, <i>once</i> the burden of my left
arm, in the temple of Juno, at Argos, the realm of Abas. All things are
<i>ever</i> changing; nothing perishes. The soul wanders about and comes
from that spot to this, from this to that, and takes possession of any
limbs whatever; it both passes from the beasts to human bodies, and
<i>so does</i> our <i>soul</i> into the beasts; and in no <i>lapse</i>
of time does it perish. And as the pliable wax is moulded into new
forms, and no <i>longer</i> abides as it was <i>before</i>, nor
preserves the same shape, but yet is still the same <i>wax</i>, so I
tell you that the soul is ever the same, but passes into different
forms. Therefore, that natural affection may not be vanquished by the
craving of the appetite, cease, I&nbsp;warn you, to expel the souls of
your kindred <i>from their bodies</i> by this dreadful slaughter; and
let not blood be nourished with blood.</p>

<p>“And, since I am <i>now</i> borne over the wide ocean, and I have
given my full sails to the winds, there is nothing in all the world that
continues in the same state. All things are flowing <i>onward</i>,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag15_12" id = "tag15_12" href =
"#note15_12">12</a> and every shape is assumed in a fleeting course.
Even time itself glides on with a constant progress, no otherwise than a
river. For neither can the river, nor the fleeting hour stop in its
course; but, as wave is impelled by wave, and the one before is pressed
on by that which follows, and <i>itself</i> presses on that before it;
so do the moments similarly fly on, and similarly do they follow, and
they are ever renewed. For the moment which was before, is past; and
that which was not, <i>now</i> exists; and every minute is replaced. You
see, too, the night emerge and proceed onward to the dawn, and this
brilliant light of the day succeed the dark night. Nor is there the same
appearance in the heavens, when all things in their weariness lie in the
midst of repose, and when Lucifer is coming forth on his white steed;
and, again, there is another appearance, when <i>Aurora</i>, the
daughter of Pallas, preceding the day, tints the world about to be
delivered to Phœbus. The disk itself of <i>that</i> God, when it is
rising from beneath the earth, is of ruddy colour in the morning, and
when it is hiding beneath the earth it is of a ruddy colour. At its
height it is of brilliant whiteness, because there the nature of the
æther
<span class = "pagenum">524</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 195-229.</span>
is purer, and far away, he avoids <i>all</i> infection from the earth.
Nor can there ever be the same or a similar appearance of the nocturnal
Diana; and always that of the present day is less than on the morrow, if
she is on the increase; <i>but</i> greater if she is contracting her
orb.</p>

<p>“And further. Do you not see the year, affording a resemblance of our
life, assume four <i>different</i> appearances? for, in early Spring, it
is mild, and <i>like</i> a nursling, and greatly resembling the age of
youth. Then, the blade is shooting, and void of strength, it swells, and
is flaccid, and delights the husbandman in his expectations. Then, all
things are in blossom, and the genial meadow smiles with the tints of
its flowers; and not as yet is there any vigour in the leaves. The year
<i>now</i> waxing stronger, after the Spring, passes into the Summer;
and in its youth it becomes robust. And indeed no season is there more
vigorous, or more fruitful, or which glows with greater warmth. Autumn
follows, the ardour of youth <i>now</i> removed, ripe, and placed
between youth and old age, moderate in his temperature, with a
<i>few</i> white hairs sprinkled over his temples. Then comes aged
Winter, repulsive with his tremulous steps, either stript of his locks,
or white with those which he has.</p>

<p>“Our own bodies too are changing always and without any intermission,
and to-morrow we shall not be what we were or what we <i>now</i> are.
The time was, when only as embryos, and the earliest hope of human
beings, we lived in the womb of the mother. Nature applied her skilful
hands, and willed not that our bodies should be tortured <i>by</i> being
shut up within the entrails of the distended parent, and brought us
forth from our dwelling into the vacant air. Brought to light, the
infant lies without <i>any</i> strength; soon, <i>like</i> a quadruped,
it uses its limbs after the manner of the brutes; and by degrees it
stands upright, shaking, and with knees still unsteady, the sinews being
supported by some assistance. Then he becomes strong and swift, and
passes over the hours of youth; and the years of middle age, too, now
past, he glides adown the steep path of declining age. This undermines
and destroys the robustness of former years; and Milo,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag15_13" id = "tag15_13" href = "#note15_13">13</a> <i>now</i>
grown old, weeps
<span class = "pagenum">525</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 229-264.</span>
when he sees the arms, which equalled those of Hercules in the
massiveness of the solid muscles, hang weak and exhausted. The daughter
of Tyndarus weeps, too, as she beholds in her mirror the wrinkles of old
age, and enquires of herself why it is that she was twice ravished.
Thou, Time, the consumer of <i>all</i> things, and thou, hateful Old
Age, <i>together</i> destroy all things; and, by degrees ye consume each
thing, decayed by the teeth of age, with a slow death.</p>

<p>“These things too, which we call elements, are not of unchanging
duration; pay attention, and I will teach you what changes they
undergo.</p>

<p>“The everlasting universe contains four elementary bodies. Two of
these, <i>namely</i>, earth and water, are heavy, and are borne
downwards by their weight; and as many are devoid of weight, and air,
and fire still purer than air, nothing pressing them, seek the higher
regions. Although these are separated in space, yet all things are made
from them, and are resolved into them. Both the earth dissolving distils
into flowing water; the water, too, evaporating, departs in the breezes
and the air; its weight being removed again, the most subtle air shoots
upwards into the fires <i>of the æther</i> on high. Thence do they
return back again, and the same order is unravelled; for fire becoming
gross, passes into dense air; this <i>changes</i> into water, and earth
is formed of the water made dense. Nor does its own form remain to each;
and nature, the renewer of <i>all</i> things, re-forms one shape from
another. And, believe me, in this universe so vast, nothing perishes;
but it varies and changes its appearance; and to begin to be something
different from what it was before, is called being born; and to cease to
be the same thing, <i>is to be said</i> to die. Whereas, perhaps, those
things are transferred hither, and these things thither; yet, in the
whole, all things <i>ever</i> exist.</p>

<p>“For my part, I cannot believe that anything lasts long under the
same form. ’Twas thus, ye ages, that ye came down to the iron from the
gold; ’tis thus, that thou hast so often changed the lot of
<i>various</i> places. I&nbsp;have beheld that <i>as</i> sea, which once
had been the most solid earth. I&nbsp;have seen land made from the sea;
and far away from the ocean the sea-shells lay,
<span class = "pagenum">526</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 264-285.</span>
and old anchors were found <i>there</i> on the tops of the mountains.
That which was a plain, a&nbsp;current of water has made into a valley,
and by a flood the mountain has been levelled into a plain; the ground
that was swampy is parched with dry sand; and places which have endured
drought, are wet with standing pools. Here nature has opened fresh
springs, but there she has shut them up; and rivers have burst forth,
aroused by ancient earthquakes; or, vanishing, they have subsided.</p>

<p>“Thus, after the Lycus<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_14" id =

it is moved, may close these caverns <i>and</i> open others; or if the

take fire, or yellow sulphur is being dried up with a smouldering smoke,

<p>“But these <i>which I have named</i> derive their origin from other
particulars; there is one bird which renews and reproduces itself. The
Assyrians call it the Phœnix. It lives not on corn or grass, but on
drops of frankincense, and the juices of the amomum. This <i>bird</i>,
when it has completed the five ages of its life, with its talons and its
crooked beak constructs for itself a nest in the branches of a holm-oak,
or on the top of a quivering palm. As soon as it has strewed in this
cassia and ears of sweet spikenard and bruised cinnamon with yellow
myrrh, it lays itself down on it, and finishes its life in the midst of
odours. They say that thence, from the body of its parent, is reproduced
a little Phœnix, which is destined to live as many years. When time has
given it strength, and it is able to bear the weight, it lightens the
branches of the lofty tree of the burden of the nest, and dutifully
carries both its own cradle and the sepulchre of its parent; and, having
reached the city of Hyperion through the yielding air, it lays it down
before the sacred doors in the temple of Hyperion.</p>

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The Poet having now exhausted nearly all the transformations which
ancient history afforded him, proceeds to enlist in the number some of
the real phenomena of nature, together with some imaginary ones. As
Pythagoras was considered to have pursued metaphysical studies more
deeply, perhaps, than any other of the ancient philosophers, Ovid could
not have introduced a personage more fitted to discuss these subjects.
Having travelled through Asia, it is supposed that Pythagoras passed
into Italy, and settled at Crotona, to promulgate there the
philosophical principles which he had acquired in his travels through
Egypt and Asia Minor.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Pythagorean philosophy was well-suited for the purpose of mingling
its doctrines with the fabulous narratives of the Poet, as it consisted,
in great part, of the doctrine of an endless series of transformations.
Its main features may be reduced to two general heads; the first of
which was the doctrine of the Metempsychosis, or continual
transmigration of souls from one body into another. Pythagoras is
supposed not to have originated this doctrine, but to have received it
from the Egyptians, by whose priesthood there is little doubt that it
was generally promulgated. Some writers have suggested that this
transmigration was only taught by Pythagoras in a metaphorical sense;
as, for instance, when he said that the souls of men were transferred to
beasts, it was only to teach us that irregular passions render us
brutes; on examination, however, we shall find that there is no ground
to doubt that he intended his doctrines to be understood according to
the literal meaning of his words; indeed, the more strongly to enforce
his doctrine by a personal illustration, he was in the habit of
promulgating that he remembered to have been Euphorbus, at the time of
the siege of Troy, and that his soul, after several other
transmigrations, had at last entered the body which it then inhabited,
under the name of Pythagoras. In consequence of this doctrine, it was a
favourite tenet of his followers to abstain from eating the flesh of
animals, for fear of unconsciously devouring some friend or kinsman.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The second feature of this philosophy consisted in the elucidation of
the changes that happen in the physical world, a&nbsp;long series of
which is here set forth by the Poet; truth being mingled at random with
fiction. While some of his facts are based upon truth, others seem to
have only emanated from the fertile invention of the travellers of those
days; of the latter kind are the stories of the river of Thrace, whose
waters petrified those who drank of it; the fountains that kindled wood,
that caused a change of sex, that created an aversion to wine, that
transformed men into birds, and fables of a similar nature; such, too,
are those stories which were generally believed by even the educated men
of antiquity,
<span class = "pagenum">536</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 478-499.</span>
but which the wisdom of modern times has long since shown to be utterly
baseless, as, for instance, that bees grew from the entrails of the ox,
and hornets from those of the horse. The principle of Pythagoras, that
everything is continually changing and that nothing perishes, is true to
a certain extent; but in his times, and even in those of Ovid,
philosophy was not sufficiently advanced to speak with precision on the
subject, and to discover the true boundary between truth and
fiction.</p>

rites of sacrifice, and brought over to the arts of peace a race inured
to savage warfare. After, full of years, he had finished his reign and
his life, the Latian matrons and the people and the Senators lamented
Numa at his death. But his wife, leaving the city, lay hid, concealed in
the thick groves of the valley of Aricia, and by her groans and
lamentations disturbed the sacred rites of Diana, brought thither by
Orestes. Ah! how oft did the Nymphs of the grove and of the lake entreat
her not to do so, and utter soothing words. Ah! how often did the hero,
the son of Theseus, say to her as she wept, “Put an end to it; for thy
lot is not the only one to be lamented. Consider the like calamities of
others, thou wilt <i>then</i> bear thine own better. And would that an
example, not my own, could lighten thy grief! yet even my own can

through mortification at her repulse) she charged me. And my father
expelled me, <i>thus</i> innocent, from the city, and as I went he
uttered imprecations against my head, with ruthless prayers. I&nbsp;was
going to Trœzen, <i>the city</i> of Pittheus,<a class = "tag" name =

chariot, and I was now proceeding along the shores of the Corinthian
gulf, when the sea was aroused, and an enormous mass of waters seemed to
bend and to grow in the form of a mountain, and to send forth a roaring
noise, and to burst asunder at its very summit. Thence, the waves being
divided, a&nbsp;horned bull was sent forth, and erect in the light air
as far as his breast, he vomited forth a quantity of sea-water from his
nostrils and his open mouth. The hearts of my attendants quailed; my
mind remained without fear, intent <i>only</i> on my exile, when the
fierce horses turned their necks towards the sea, and were terrified,
with ears erect; and they were alarmed with dread of the monster, and
precipitated the chariot over the lofty rocks. I&nbsp;struggled, with
unavailing hand, to guide the bridle covered with white foam, and,
throwing myself backwards, I&nbsp;pulled back the loosened reins. And,
indeed, the madness of my steeds would not have exceeded that strength
<i>of mine</i>, had not the wheel, by running against a stump, been
broken and disjoined just where it turns round on the long
axle-tree.</p>

<p>“I was hurled from my chariot; and, the reins entwined around my
limbs, you might have seen my palpitating entrails dragged, my sinews
fasten upon the stump, my limbs partly torn to pieces and partly left
behind, being caught by <i>various obstacles</i>, my bones in their
breaking emit a loud noise, and my exhausted breath become exhaled, and

that I might be safe, and be seen in security, she gave me a <i>more</i>
aged appearance, and left me no features that could be recognized. For a
long time she was doubtful whether she should give me Crete or Delos for
me to possess. Delos and Crete being abandoned, she placed me here, and,
at the same time, she ordered me to lay aside my name, which might have
reminded me of my steeds, and she said, ‘Thou, the same who wast
Hippolytus, be thou now Virbius.’<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_57" id =

<p>But yet the misfortunes of others were not able to alleviate the
grief of Egeria; and, throwing herself down at the base of the hill, she
dissolved into tears; until, moved by her affection as she grieved, the
sister of Phœbus formed a cool fountain from her body, and dissolved her
limbs in ever-flowing waters.</p>

Amazon<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_59" id = "tag15_59" href =
"#note15_59">59</a> was astonished, in no other manner than as when the
Etrurian ploughman beheld the fate-revealing clod in the midst of the
fields move at first of its own accord and no one touching it, and
afterwards assume a human form, and lose <i>that</i> of earth, and open
its new-made mouth with <i>the decrees of</i> future destiny. The
natives called him Tages. He was the first to teach the Etrurian nation
to foretell future events.</p>

<p>Or, as when Romulus once saw his lance, fixed in the
<span class = "pagenum">539</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 561-598.</span>
Palatine hill, suddenly shoot forth; which <i>now</i> stood there with a
root newly-formed, <i>and</i> not with the iron <i>point</i> driven in;
and, now no longer as a dart, but as a tree with limber twigs, it sent
forth, for the admiring <i>spectators</i>, a&nbsp;shade that was not
looked for.</p>

<p>Or, <i>as</i> when Cippus beheld his horns in the water of the
stream, (for he did see them) and, believing that there was a false
representation in the reflection, often returning his fingers to his
forehead, he touched what he saw. And now, no <i>longer</i> condemning
his own eyesight, he stood still, as he was returning victorious from
the conquest of the enemy; and raising his eyes towards heaven, and his
hands in the same direction, he exclaimed, “Ye Gods above! whatever is
portended by this prodigy, if it is auspicious, then be it auspicious to
my country and to the people of Quirinus; but if unfortunate, be it
<i>so</i> for myself.” And <i>then</i> he made atonement at the grassy
altars built of green turf, with odoriferous fires, and presented wine
in bowls, and consulted the panting entrails of slaughtered sheep what
the meaning of it was. Soon as the soothsayer of the Etrurian nation had
inspected them, he beheld in them the great beginnings of <i>future</i>
events, but still not clearly. But when he raised his searching eyes
from the entrails of the sheep, to the horns of Cippus, he said, “Hail,
O&nbsp;king! for thee, Cippus, thee and thy horns shall this place and
the Latian towers obey. Only do thou lay aside all delay; hasten to
enter the gates wide open; thus the fates command thee. For, <i>once</i>
received within the City, thou shalt be king, and thou shalt safely
enjoy a lasting sceptre.” He retreated backwards, and turning his stern
visage away from the walls of the City, he exclaimed, “Far, O&nbsp;far
away may the Gods drive such omens! Much more righteously shall I pass
my life in exile, than if the Capitol were to see me a king.”</p>

<p><i>Thus</i> he says; and forthwith he convokes the people and the
dignified Senate; but first, he veils his horns with laurel that
betokens peace, and he stands upon a mound raised by his brave soldiers;
and praying to the Gods after the ancient manner, “Behold!” says he,
“one is here who will be king, if you do not expel him from the City.
I&nbsp;will tell you who he is by a sign, <i>and</i> not by name. He
wears horns on his forehead; the augur predicts to you, that if he
enters the City, he shall give you laws as his slaves. He, indeed, was
able to
<span class = "pagenum">540</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 598-621.</span>
enter the open gates, but I have opposed him; although no one is more
nearly allied with him than myself. Forbid your City to this man, ye
Romans, or, if he shall deserve it, bind him with heavy fetters; or else
end your fears by the death of the destined tyrant.”</p>

<p>As the murmur which arises among the groves of the slender pine,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag15_60" id = "tag15_60" href =
"#note15_60">60</a> when the furious East wind whistles among them, or
as that which the waves of the ocean produce, if any one hears them from
afar, such is the noise of the crowd. But yet amid the confused words of
the shouting multitude, one cry is distinguished, “Which is he?” And
then they examine the foreheads, and seek the predicted horns. Cippus
again addresses them: “Him whom you require, ye <i>now</i> have;” and,
despite of the people, throwing the chaplet from his head, he exhibits
his temples, remarkable for two horns. All cast down their eyes, and
utter groans, and (who would have supposed it?) they unwillingly look
upon that head famed for its merits. And no longer suffering it to be
deprived of its honours, they place upon it the festive chaplet. But the
nobles, Cippus, since thou art forbidden to enter the city, give thee as

Ovid, following the notion that was generally entertained of the wisdom
of Numa, pretends that before he was elected to the sovereignty he went
to Crotona, for the purpose of studying under Pythagoras; but he is
guilty of a considerable anachronism in this instance, as Pythagoras was
not born till very many years after the time of Numa. According to Livy,
Pythagoras flourished in the time of Servius Tullius, the sixth Roman
king, about one hundred and fifty years after Numa. Modern authors are
of opinion that upwards of two hundred years intervened between the days
of Numa and Pythagoras. Besides, Dionysius of Halicarnassus distinctly
asserts that the city of Crotona was only built in the fourth year of
the reign of Numa Pompilius.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Numa is said to have been in the habit of retiring to the Arician grove,
to consult the Nymph Egeria upon the laws which he was about to
promulgate for the benefit of his subjects. It is probable, that to
ensure
<span class = "pagenum">541</span>
their observance the more effectually, he wished the people to believe
that his enactments were compiled under the inspection of one who
partook of the immortal nature, and that in so doing he followed the
example of previous lawgivers. Zamolxis pretended that the laws which he
gave to the Scythians were dictated to him by his attendant genius or
spirit. The first Minos affirmed that Jupiter was the author of the
ordinances which he gave to the people of Crete, while Lycurgus
attributed his to Apollo. It is not improbable that in this they
imitated the example of Moses, a&nbsp;tradition of whose reception of
the laws on Mount Sinai they may have received from the people of
Phœnicia.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Dionysius of Halicarnassus has an interesting passage relative to Numa,
which throws some light upon his alleged intercourse with the Nymph
Egeria. His words are&mdash; ‘The Romans affirm that Numa was never
engaged in any warlike expedition; but that he passed his whole reign in
profound peace: that his first care was to encourage piety and justice
in his dominions, and to civilize his people by good and wholesome laws.
His profound skill in governing made him pass for being inspired, and
gave rise to many fabulous stories. Some have said that he had secret
interviews with the Nymph Egeria; others, that he frequently consulted
one of the Muses, and was instructed by her in the art of government.
Numa was desirous to confirm the people in this opinion; but because
some hesitated to believe his bare affirmation, and others went so far
as to call his alleged converse with the Deities a fiction, he took an
opportunity to give them such proofs of it, that the most sceptical
among them should have no room left for suspicion. This he effected in
the following manner. He one day invited several of the nobles to his
palace, and showed them the plainness of the apartments, where no rich
furniture was to be seen, nor any thing like an attempt at splendour;
and how even the most ordinary necessaries were wanting for anything
like a great entertainment; after which, he dismissed them with an
invitation to come to sup with him on the same night. At the appointed
hour his guests arrived; they were received on stately couches; the
tables were decked with a variety of plate, and were loaded with the
most exquisite dainties. The guests were struck with the sumptuousness
and profusion of the entertainment, and considering how impossible it
was for any man to have made such preparations in so short a time, were
persuaded that his communication with heaven was not a fiction, and that
he must have had the aid of the celestial powers to do things of a
nature so extraordinary.<ins class = "correction" title = "‘ missing">
‘</ins>But,’ as the same author says, ‘those who were not so ready at
adopting fabulous narratives as a part of history, say that it was the
policy of Numa which led him to feign a conversation with the Nymph
Egeria, to make his laws respected by his people, and that he thence
followed the example of the Greek sages, who adopted the same method of
enforcing the authority of their laws with the people.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Romans were so persuaded of the fact of Numa’s conferences with the
Nymph Egeria, that they went into the grove of Aricia to seek her; but
finding nothing but a fountain in the spot which he used to frequent,
they promulgated the story of the transformation of the Nymph. St.
Augustin, speaking on this subject, says that Numa made use
<span class = "pagenum">542</span>
of the waters of that fountain in the divination which was performed by
the aid of water, and was called Hydromancy.</p>

Theseus having left Ariadne in the isle of Naxos, flattered himself with
the hopes of marrying her sister Phædra. Deucalion, succeeding Minos in
Crete immediately after his death, sent Phædra to Athens. On arriving
there, she fell in love with Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, who had
been brought up at Trœzen by Pittheus. As she did not dare to request of
Theseus that his son might be brought from the court of Pittheus, she
built a temple to Venus near Trœzen, that she might the more frequently
have the opportunity of seeing Hippolytus, and called it by the name of
Hippolyteum. <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Acccording’">According</ins> to Euripides, this youth was wise, chaste,
and an enemy to all voluptuousness. He spent his time in hunting and
chariot racing, with other exercises which formed the pursuits of youths
of high station. According to Plutarch, it was at the time when Theseus
was a prisoner in Epirus, that Phædra took the opportunity of disclosing
to Hippolytus the violence of her passion for him. Her declaration being
but ill received, she grew desperate on his refusal to comply with her
desires, and was about to commit self-destruction, when her nurse
suggested the necessity of revenging the virtuous disdain of the
youth.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Theseus having been liberated by Hercules, Phædra, being fearful lest
the intrigue should come to his knowledge, hanged herself, having first
written a letter to inform him that she could not survive an attempt
which Hippolytus had made on her virtue. Plutarch, Servius and Hyginus,
following Euripides, give this account of her death. But Seneca, in his
Hippolytus, says that she only appeared before her husband in extreme
grief, holding a sword in her hand to signify the violence which
Hippolytus had offered her. On this, Theseus implored the assistance of
Neptune, who sent a monster out of the sea, to frighten his horses, as
he was driving along the sea-shore: on which, they took fright, and
throwing him from his chariot, he was killed. It has been suggested that
the true meaning of this is, that Theseus having ordered his son to come
and justify himself, he made so much haste that his horses ran away with
him; and his chariot being dashed over the rocks, he was killed.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Seneca also differs from the other writers, in saying that Phædra did
not put herself to death till she had heard of the catastrophe of
Hippolytus, on which she stabbed herself. The people of Trœzen,
regretting his loss, decreed him divine honours, built a temple, and
appointed a priest to offer yearly sacrifices to him. Euripides says,
that the young women of Trœzen, when about to be married, cut off their
hair and carried it to the temple of Hippolytus. It was also promulgated
that the Gods had translated him to the heavens, where he was changed
into the Constellation, called by the Latins ‘Auriga,’ or ‘the
Charioteer.’ Later authors, whom Ovid here follows, added, that
Æsculapius restored him to life, and that he afterwards appeared in
Italy under the name of Virbius. This story was probably invented as a
source of profit by the priesthood, who were desirous to find some good
reason for introducing his worship into the Arician grove near Rome.
This story is mentioned by Apollodorus, who quotes the author of the
Naupactan verses in favour of it, and by the Scholiasts of Euripides and
Pindar.</p>

The ancient Etrurians were great adepts in the art of divination; their
favourite method of exercising which was by the inspection of the
entrails of beasts, and the observation of the flight of birds; and from
them, as we learn from Cicero in his book on Divination, the system
spread over the whole of Italy. Tages is supposed to have been the first
who taught this art, and he wrote treatises upon it, which, according to
Plutarch, were quoted by ancient authors. It not being known whence he
came, or who were his parents, he was called, in the language of the
poets, a&nbsp;son of the earth. Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of him as
being said to have sprung out of the earth in Etruria.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Ovid next makes a passing allusion to the spear of Romulus, which, when
thrown by him from the Mount Aventine towards the Capitol, sticking in
the ground was converted into a tree, which immediately put forth
leaves. This prodigy was taken for a presage of the future greatness of
Rome: and Plutarch, in his life of Romulus, says that so long as this
tree stood, the Republic flourished. It began to wither in the time of
the first civil war; and Julius Cæsar having afterwards ordered a
building to be erected near where it stood, the workmen cutting some of
its roots in sinking the foundations, it soon after died. It is hardly
probable that a cornel tree would stand in a thronged city for nearly
seven hundred years; and it is, therefore, most likely, that care was
taken to renovate it from time to time, by planting slips from the
former tree.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The story of Genucius Cippus is one of those strange fables with which
the Roman history is diversified. Valerius Maximus gives the following
account of it. He says that Cippus, going one day out of Rome, suddenly
found that something which resembled horns was growing out of his
forehead. Surprised at an event so extraordinary, he consulted the
augurs, who said that he would be chosen king, if he ever entered the
city again. As the royal power was abhorred in Rome, he preferred a
voluntary banishment to revisiting Rome on those terms. Struck with this
heroism, the Romans erected a brazen statue with horns over the gate by
which he departed, and it was afterwards called ‘Porta raudusculana,’
because the ancient Latin name of brass was ‘raudus,’ ‘rodus,’ or
‘rudus.’ The fact is, however, as Ovid represents it, that Cippus was
not going out of Rome, but returning to it, when the prodigy happened;
he having been to convey assistance to the Consul Valerius. The Senate
also conferred certain lands on Cippus, as a reward for his patriotism.
He lived about two hundred and forty years before the Christian era.
Pliny the Elder considers the story of the horns of Cippus as much a
fable as that of Actæon. It appears, however, that the account of the
horns may have possibly been founded on fact, as excrescences resembling
them have appeared on the bodies of individuals. Bayle makes mention of
a girl of Palermo, who had little horns all over her body, like those of
a young calf. In the Ashmolean museum at Oxford, a&nbsp;substance much
resembling the horn of a goat is shown, which is said to have sprung
from the forehead of a female named Mary Davis, whose likeness is there
shown. The excrescence was most probably produced by a deranged
secretion of the hair, and something of a similar nature may perhaps
have befallen Genucius Cippus, which, of course, would be made the
<span class = "pagenum">544</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 622-641.</span>
most of in those ages of superstition. Valerius Maximus, with all his
credulity, does not say that they were real horns that made their
appearance, but that they were ‘just like horns.’</p>

<p class = "explanation">
It is not improbable that the story originally was, that Cippus, on his
return to Rome, dreamt that he had horns on his head, and that having
consulted the augurs, and received the answer mentioned by Ovid, he
preferred to suffer exile, rather than enslave his country; and that, in
length of time, the more wonderful part of the story was added
to&nbsp;it.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Rome</span> being wasted by a pestilence, the
Delphian oracle is consulted; and the answer is given, that to cause it
to cease Æsculapius must be brought to Rome. On this, ambassadors are
sent to Epidaurus to demand the God. The people refuse to part with him;
but he appears to one of the Romans in a dream, and consents to go. On
his arrival at Rome the contagion ceases, and a Temple is built in his
honour.</p>

<p>Relate, now, ye Muses, the guardian Deities of poets (for you know,
and remote antiquity conceals it not from you), whence <i>it is that</i>
the Island surrounded by the channel of the Tiber introduced the son of
Coronis into the sacred rites of the City of Romulus. A&nbsp;dire
contagion had once infected the Latian air, and the pale bodies were
deformed by a consumption that dried up the blood. When, wearied with
<i>so many</i> deaths, they found that mortal endeavours availed
nothing, and that the skill of physicians had no effect, they sought the
aid of heaven, and they repaired to Delphi which occupies the centre
spot of the world, the oracle of Phœbus, and entreated that he would aid
their distressed circumstances by a response productive of health, and
put an end to the woes of a City so great. Both the spot, and the
laurels, and the quivers which it has, shook at the same moment, and the
tripod<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_61" id = "tag15_61" href =
"#note15_61">61</a> gave this answer from the recesses of the shrine,
and struck <i>with awe</i> their astonished breasts:&mdash; “What here
thou dost seek, O&nbsp;Roman, thou mightst have sought in a nearer spot:
and now seek it in a nearer spot; thou hast no need of Apollo to
diminish thy grief, but of the son of Apollo. Go with a good omen, and
invite my son.”</p>

<p>After the prudent Senate had received the commands of the
<span class = "pagenum">545</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 641-677.</span>
Deity, they enquired what city the youthful son of Phœbus inhabited; and
they sent some to reach the coasts of Epidaurus<a class = "tag" name =
"tag15_62" id = "tag15_62" href = "#note15_62">62</a> with the winds.
Soon as those sent had reached them in the curving ship, they repaired
to the council and the Grecian elders, and besought them to grant them
the Divinity, who by his presence could put an end to the mortality of
the Ausonian nation; <i>for</i> that so the unerring response had
directed. Their opinions were divided, and differed; and some thought
that aid ought not to be refused. Many refused it, and advised them not
to part with their own protector, and to give up their own guardian
Deity. While they were deliberating, twilight had <i>now</i> expelled
the waning day, and the shadow of the earth had brought darkness over
the world; when, in thy sleep, the saving God seemed, O&nbsp;Roman, to
be standing before thy couch; but just as he is wont to be in his
temple; and, holding a rustic staff in his left hand, <i>he seemed</i>
to be stroking the long hair of his beard with his right, and to utter
such words as these from his kindly breast&mdash; “Lay aside thy fears;
I&nbsp;will come, and I will leave these <i>my</i> statues. Only observe
<i>now</i> this serpent, which with its folds entwines around this
staff, and accurately mark it with thine eyes, that thou mayst be able
to know it again. Into this shall I be changed; but I shall be greater,
and I shall appear to be of a size as great as that into which heavenly
bodies ought to be transformed.”</p>

<p>Forthwith, with <i>these</i> words, the God departs; and with his
words and the God sleep <i>departs</i>, and genial light follows upon
the departure of sleep. The following morn has <i>now</i> dispersed the
starry fires; uncertain what to do, the nobles meet together in the
sumptuous temple of the God <i>then</i> sought, and beseech him to
indicate, by celestial tokens, in what spot he would wish to abide.
Hardly have they well ceased, when the God, all glittering with gold, in
<i>the form of</i> a serpent, with crest erect, sends forth a hissing,
as a notice of his approach; and in his coming, he shakes both his
statue, the altars, the doors, the marble pavement, and the gilded roof,
and as far as the breast he stands erect in the midst of the temple, and
rolls around his eyes that sparkle with fire. The frightened multitude
is alarmed; the priest, having his chaste hair bound with a white
fillet, recognizes the Deity and exclaims, “The God!
<span class = "pagenum">546</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 677-706.</span>
Behold the God! Whoever you are that are present, be of good omen, both
with your words and your feelings. Mayst thou, most beauteous one, be
beheld to our advantage; and mayst thou aid the nations that perform thy
sacred rites.” Whoever are present, adore the Deity as bidden; and all
repeat the words of the priest over again; and the descendants of Æneas
give a pious omen, both with their feelings, and in their words. To
these the God shows favour; and with crest erected, he gives a hiss,
a&nbsp;sure token, repeated thrice with his vibrating tongue. Then he
glides down the polished steps,<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_63" id =
"tag15_63" href = "#note15_63">63</a> and turns back his head, and,
about to depart, he looks back upon his ancient altars, and salutes his
wonted abode and the temple that <i>so long</i> he has inhabited. Then,
with his vast bulk, he glides along the ground covered with the strewn
flowers, and coils his folds, and through the midst of the city repairs
to the harbour protected by its winding quay.</p>

<p>Here he stops; and seeming to dismiss his train, and the dutiful
attendance of the accompanying crowd, with a placid countenance, he
places his body in the Ausonian ship. It is sensible of the weight of
the God; and the ship <i>now</i> laden with the Divinity for its
freight, the descendants of Æneas rejoice; and a bull having first been
slain on the sea-shore, they loosen the twisted cables of the bark
bedecked with garlands. A&nbsp;gentle breeze has <i>now</i> impelled the

<p>After the sailors have steered the sail-bearing ship hither (for now
the sea is aroused), the Deity unfolds his coils, and gliding with many
a fold and in vast coils, he enters the temple of his parent, that
skirts the yellow shore. The sea <i>now</i> becalmed, the <i>God</i> of
Epidaurus leaves the altars of his sire; and having enjoyed the
hospitality of the Deity, <i>thus</i> related to him, he furrows the
sands of the sea-shore with the dragging of his rattling scales, and
reclining against the helm of the ship, he places his head upon the
lofty stern; until he comes to Castrum,<a class = "tag" name =

indiscriminately, a&nbsp;crowd both of matrons and of men, rush to meet
him; they, too, Vesta! who tend thy fires; and with joyous shouts they
welcome the God. And where the swift ship is steered through the tide
running out, altars being erected in a line, the frankincense crackles
along <i>the banks</i> on either side, and perfumes the air with its
smoke; the felled victim too, <i>with its blood</i> makes warm the
knives thrust <i>into it</i>.</p>

<p>And now he has entered Rome, the sovereign of the world. The serpent
rises erect, and lifts his neck that reclines against the top of the
mast, and looks around for a habitation suited for himself. <i>There is
a spot, where</i> the river flowing around, is divided into two parts;
it is called “the Island.” <i>The river</i> in the direction of each
side extends its arms of equal length, the dry land <i>lying</i> in the
middle. Hither, the serpent, son of Phœbus, betakes himself from the
Latian ship; and he puts an end to the mourning, having resumed his
celestial form. And <i>thus</i> did he come, the restorer of health, to
the City.</p>

which we will shortly refer for an explanation.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
Under the consulate of Quintus Fabius Gurges, and Decimus Junius Brutus
Scæva, Rome was ravaged by a frightful pestilence. The resources of
physic having been exhausted, the Sibylline books were consulted to
ascertain by what expedient the calamity might be put an end to, and
they found that the plague would not cease till they had brought
Æsculapius from Epidaurus to Rome. Being then engaged in war, they
postponed their application to the Epidaurians for a year, at the end of
which time they despatched an embassy to Epidaurus; on which a serpent
was delivered to them, which the priests of the Deity
<span class = "pagenum">549</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 745-762.</span>
assured them was the God himself. Taking it on board their ship, the
delegates set sail. When near Antium, they were obliged to put in there
by stress of weather, and the serpent, escaping from the ship, remained
three days on shore; after which it came on board of its own accord, and
they continued their voyage. On arriving at the Island of the Tiber the
serpent escaped, and concealed itself amid the reeds; and as they, in
their credulity, fancied that the God had chosen the place for his
habitation, they built a temple there in his honour. From this period,
which was about the year of Rome 462, the worship of Æsculapius was
introduced in the city, and to him recourse was had in cases of disease,
and especially in times of pestilence.</p>

were brandished; she turned pale, and said to each of the Deities, as
she met them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Behold, on how vast a scale treason is plotted against me, and with
how great perfidy that life is sought, which alone remains for me from
the Dardanian Iülus. Shall I alone be everlastingly harassed by
justified anxieties? I, whom one while the Calydonian lance of the son
of Tydeus is wounding, <i>and</i> at another time the walls of Troy,
defended in vain, are grieving? I, who have seen my son driven about in
protracted wanderings, tossed on the ocean, entering the abodes of the
departed, and waging war with Turnus; or, if we confess the truth, with
Juno rather? <i>But</i>, why am I now calling to mind the ancient
misfortunes of my own offspring? Present apprehensions do not allow me
to remember things of former days. Against me, you behold how the
impious swords are <i>now</i> being whetted. Avert them, I&nbsp;entreat;
hinder this crime, and do not, by the murder of the priest, extinguish
the flames of Vesta.”</p>

<p>Such expressions as these did Venus, full of anxiety, vainly let fall
throughout the heavens, and she moved the Gods above. Although they were
not able to frustrate the iron decrees of the aged sisters, yet they
afforded no unerring tokens of approaching woe. They say, that arms
resounding amid the black clouds, and dreadful <i>blasts of</i> the
trumpet, and clarions heard through the heavens, forewarned men of the
crime. The sad face too of the sun gave a livid light to the alarmed
earth. Often did torches seem to be burning in the midst of the stars;
often did drops of blood fall in the showers. The azure-coloured Lucifer
had his light tinted with a dark iron colour; the chariot of the moon
was besprinkled with blood. The Stygian owl gave omens of ill in a
thousand places; in a thousand places did the ivory statues shed tears;
dirges, too, are said to have been heard, and threatening expressions in
the sacred groves. No victim gave an omen of good; the entrails, too,
showed that great tumults were imminent; and the extremity <i>of the
liver</i> was found cut off among the entrails. They say, too, that in
the Forum, and around the houses and the temples of the Gods, the dogs
were howling by night; and that the ghosts of the departed were walking,
and that the City was
<span class = "pagenum">551</span>
<span class = "linenum">xv. 798-826.</span>
shaken by earthquakes. But still the warnings of the Gods could not
avert treachery and the approach of Fate, and drawn swords were carried
into a temple; and no other place in the <i>whole</i> City than the
Senate-house pleased them for this crime and this atrocious murder.</p>

<p>But then did Cytherea beat her breast with both her hands, and
attempt to hide the descendant of Æneas in a cloud, in which, long
since, Paris was conveyed from the hostile son of Atreus,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag15_85" id = "tag15_85" href = "#note15_85">85</a> and
Æneas had escaped from the sword of Diomedes. In such words as these
<i>did</i> her father <i>Jove address her</i>: “Dost thou, my daughter,
unaided, attempt to change the insuperable <i>decrees</i> of Fate? Thou,
thyself, mayst enter the abode of the three sisters, <i>and</i> there
thou wilt behold the register of <i>future</i> events, <i>wrought</i>
with vast labour, of brass and of solid iron; these, safe and destined
for eternity, fear neither the <i>thundering</i> shock of the heavens,
nor the rage of the lightnings, nor any <i>source of</i> destruction.
There wilt thou find the destinies of thy descendants engraved in
everlasting adamant. I&nbsp;myself have read them, and I have marked
them in my mind; I&nbsp;will repeat them, that thou mayst not still be
ignorant of the future. He (on whose account, Cytherea, thou art
<i>thus</i> anxious), has completed his time, those years being ended
which he owed to the earth. Thou, with his son, who, as the heir to his
glory, will bear the burden of government devolving <i>on him</i>, wilt
cause him, as a Deity, to reach the heavens, and to be worshipped in
temples; and he, as a most valiant avenger of his murdered parent, will
have us to aid him in his battles. The conquered walls of Mutina,<a

<p>Hardly had he uttered these words, when the genial Venus, perceived
by none, stood in the very midst of the Senate-house, and snatched the
soul, just liberated <i>from the body</i>, away from the limbs of her
own Cæsar, and, not suffering it to dissolve in air, she bore it amid
the stars of heaven. And as she bore it, she perceived it assume a
<i>train of</i> light and become inflamed; and she dropped it from her
bosom. Above the moon it takes its flight, and, as a star, it glitters,
carrying a flaming train with a lengthened track; and, as he beholds the
illustrious deeds of his son, he confesses that they are superior to his
own, and rejoices that he is surpassed by him. Although <i>Augustus</i>
forbids his own actions to be lauded before those of his father, still
Fame, in her freedom and subject to no commands, prefers him against his
will; and, in <i>this</i> one point, she disobeys him. Thus does Atreus
yield to the glories of the great Agamemnon; thus does Theseus excel
Ægeus, <i>and</i> thus Achilles Peleus. In fine, that I may use examples
that equal themselves, thus too, is Saturn inferior to

EXPLANATION.</a></h6>

<p class = "explanation">
The Poet having fulfilled his promise, and having brought down his work
from the beginning of the world to his own times, concludes it with the
apotheosis of Julius Cæsar. He here takes an opportunity of
complimenting Augustus, as being more worthy of divine honours than even
his predecessor, while he promises him a long and glorious reign.
Augustus, however, had not to wait for death to receive divine honours,
as he enjoyed the glory of seeing himself worshipped as a Deity and
adored at altars erected to him, even in his lifetime. According to
<span class = "pagenum">554</span>
Appian, he was but twenty-eight years of age when he was ranked among
the tutelar Divinities by all the cities of the empire.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The Romans, who deduced their origin from Æneas, were flattered at the
idea of Venus interesting herself in behalf of her posterity, and
securing the honours of an apotheosis for Julius Cæsar. The historical
circumstances which Ovid here refers to were the following:&mdash;After
Julius Cæsar had been murdered in the Senate house, Augustus ordered
public games to be instituted in his honour. We learn from Suetonius,
that during their celebration a new star, or rather a comet, made its
appearance, on which it was promulgated that the soul of the deified
Julius had taken its place among the stars, and that Venus had procured
him that honour. It was then remembered, that the light of the Sun had
been unusually pallid the whole year following the death of Cæsar; this
which is generally supposed to have been caused by some spots which then
appeared on the disk of the sun, was ascribed to the grief of Apollo.
Various persons were found to assert various prodigies. Some said that
it had rained blood, others that the moon and stars had been obscured;
while others, still more imaginative, asserted that beasts had uttered
words, and that the dead had risen from their graves.</p>

<p class = "explanation">
The sorrow of the Gods and of nature at the untimely death of Julius
being thus manifested, Augustus proceeded to found a temple in his
honour, established priests for his service, and erected a statue of him
with a star on its forehead. He was afterwards represented in the
attitude of ascending to the heavens, and wielding a sceptre in his
hand. While flatterers complimented Augustus upon the care which he had
taken to enrol his predecessor among the Deities, there were some, the
poet Manilius being of the number, who considered that heaven was almost
over-peopled by him. Augustus, however, was not the sole author of the
story of the apotheosis of Julius Cæsar. The people had previously
attempted to deify him, though opposed by Cicero and Dolabella. In the
funeral oration which was delivered over Julius Cæsar by Antony, he
spoke of him as a God, and the populace, moved by his eloquence, and
struck at his blood-stained garments and his body covered with wounds,
were filled with indignation against the conspirators, and were about to
take the corpse to the Capitol, there to be buried; but the priests
would not permit it, and had it brought back to the Forum, where it was
burnt. Dio Cassius says, that the Roman people raised an altar on the
spot where the body had been burnt, and endeavoured to make libations
and to offer sacrifices there, as to a Divinity, but that the Consuls
overthrew the altar. Suetonius says, that a pillar was also erected to
him, of about twenty feet in height, with the inscription, ‘parenti
patriæ,’ ‘To the father of his country,’ and that for some time persons
resorted to that spot to offer sacrifices and to make vows. He adds,
that he was made a Divinity by a public decree, but he does not say at
what time.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_38" id = "note15_38" href = "#tag15_38">38.</a>
<i>Far Northern Pallene.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 356. Pallene was the name of a
mountain and a city of Thrace. Tritonis was a lake in the neighbourhood.
Vibius Sequester says, ‘When a person has nine times bathed himself in
the Tritonian lake, in Thrace, he is changed into a bird.’ The
continuous fall of fleecy snow in that neighbourhood is supposed by some
to have given rise to the story.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_39" id = "note15_39" href = "#tag15_39">39.</a>
<i>Give any credit.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 361. This was a very common notion
among the ancients. See the story of Aristæus and the recovery of his
bees, in the Fourth Book of Virgil’s Georgics, I. 281-314. It is also
told by Ovid in the Fasti, Book&nbsp;I. l.&nbsp;377.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_40" id = "note15_40" href = "#tag15_40">40.</a>
<i>The warlike steed.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 368. Pliny the Elder, Nicander,
and Varro state that bees and hornets are produced from the carcase of
the horse. Pliny also says, that beetles are generated by the putrefying
carcase of the ass.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_41" id = "note15_41" href = "#tag15_41">41.</a>
<i>Deadly moth.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 374. Pliny, in the twenty-eighth Book of
his History, says, ‘The moth, too, that flies at the flame of the lamp,
is numbered among the bad potions,’ evidently alluding to their being
used in philtres or incantations. There is a kind called the death’s
head moth; but it is so called simply from the figure of a skull, which
appears very exactly represented on its body, and not on account of any
noxious qualities known to be inherent in it.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_42" id = "note15_42" href = "#tag15_42">42.</a>
<i>Deprived of feet.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 376. He alludes to frogs when in
the tadpole state.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_43" id = "note15_43" href = "#tag15_43">43.</a>
<i>Not a cub.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 379. This was long the common belief.
Pliny says, speaking of the cub of the bear, ‘These are white and
shapeless lumps of flesh, a&nbsp;little bigger than mice, without eyes,
and without hair; the claws, however, are prominent. These the dams by
degrees reduce to shape.’</p>

<p><a name = "note15_44" id = "note15_44" href = "#tag15_44">44.</a>
<i>Into a serpent.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 390. Pliny tells the same story; and
Antigonus (on Miracles, ch. 96) goes still further, and says, that the
persons to whom this happens, after death, are able to smell the snakes
while they are yet alive. The fiction, very probably, was invented with
the praiseworthy object of securing freedom from molestation for the
bones of the dead.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_45" id = "note15_45" href = "#tag15_45">45.</a>
<i>Changes its sex.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 408. Pliny mentions it as a vulgar
belief that the hyæna is male and female in alternate years. Aristotle
took the pains to confute this silly notion.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_46" id = "note15_46" href = "#tag15_46">46.</a>
<i>Which feeds upon.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 411. The idea that the chameleon
subsists on wind and air, arose from the circumstance of its sitting
with its mouth continually open, that it may catch flies and small
insects, its prey. That it changes colour according to the hue of the
surrounding objects, is a fact well known. It receives its name from the
Greek <span class = "greek" title = "chámai leôn">χάμαι λέων</span>,
‘The lion on the ground.’</p>

<p><a name = "note15_47" id = "note15_47" href = "#tag15_47">47.</a>
<i>Changed into stone.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 415. Pliny says, that this
becomes hard, and turns into gems, like the carbuncle, being of a fiery
tint, and that the stone has the name of ‘lyncurium.’ Beckmann (Hist.
Inventions) thinks that this was probably the jacinth, or hyacinth,
while others suppose it to have been the tourmaline, or transparent
amber.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_48" id = "note15_48" href = "#tag15_48">48.</a>
<i>A soft plant.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 417. Modern improvement in knowledge
has shown that coral is not a plant, but an animal substance.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_49" id = "note15_49" href = "#tag15_49">49.</a>
<i>Sparta was famed.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 426-30. These lines are looked upon
by many Commentators as spurious, as they are omitted in most MSS.
Besides, all these cities were flourishing in the <ins class =
"correction" title = "t invisible">time</ins> of Pythagoras. If they are
genuine, Ovid is here guilty of a series of anachronisms.</p>

brimstone.</p>

<p><a name = "note15_56" id = "note15_56" href = "#tag15_56">56.</a>

<i>Amphissian.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 703. Amphissia was the name of a city of
Locris; but that cannot be the place here alluded to on the coast of
Italy. It is most probably a corrupt reading.</p>

<i>Caulon.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 705. Caulon was a colony of the Achæa on the

<i>Philippi.</i>]&mdash;Ver. 824. Pharsalia was in Thessaly, and
Philippi was in Thrace. He uses a poet’s license, in treating them as
being the same battle-field, as they both formed part of the former
kingdom of Macedonia. Pompey was defeated by Julius Cæsar at Pharsalia,
while Brutus and Cassius were defeated by Augustus and Antony at
