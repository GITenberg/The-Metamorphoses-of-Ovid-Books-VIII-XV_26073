INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The</span> Metamorphoses of Ovid are a
compendium of the Mythological narratives of ancient Greece and Rome, so
ingeniously framed, as to embrace a large amount of information upon
almost every subject connected with the learning, traditions, manners,
and customs of antiquity, and have afforded a fertile field of
investigation to the learned of the civilized world. To present to the
public a faithful translation of a work, universally esteemed, not only
for its varied information, but as being the masterpiece of one of the
greatest Poets of ancient Rome, is the object of the present volume.</p>

<p>To render the work, which, from its nature and design, must, of
necessity, be replete with matter of obscure meaning, more inviting to
the scholar, and more intelligible to those who are unversed in
Classical literature, the translation is accompanied with Notes and
Explanations, which, it is believed, will be found to throw considerable
light upon the origin and meaning of some of the traditions of heathen
Mythology.</p>

<p>In the translation, the text of the Delphin edition has been
generally adopted; and no deviation has been made from it, except in a
few instances, where the reason for such a step is stated in the notes;
at the same time, the texts of Burmann and Gierig have throughout been
carefully consulted. The several editions vary materially in respect to
punctuation; the Translator has consequently used his own discretion in
adopting that which seemed to him the most fully to convey in each
passage the intended meaning of the writer.</p>

<p>The Metamorphoses of Ovid have been frequently translated into the
English language. On referring to Mr. Bohn’s excellent Catalogue of the
Greek and Latin Classics and their Translations, we find that the whole
of the work has been twice translated into English Prose, while five
translations in Verse are there enumerated. A&nbsp;prose version of the
Metamorphoses was published by Joseph Davidson<ins class = "correction"
title = ". for ,">, </ins>about the
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
middle of the last century, which professes to be “as near the original
as the different idioms of the Latin and English will allow;” and to be
“printed for the use of schools, as well as of private gentlemen.”
A&nbsp;few moments’ perusal of this work will satisfy the reader that it
has not the slightest pretension to be considered a literal translation,
while, by its departure from the strict letter of the author, it has
gained nothing in elegance of diction. It is accompanied by “critical,
historical, geographical, and classical notes in English, from the best
Commentators, both ancient and modern, beside a great number of notes,
entirely new;” but notwithstanding this announcement, these annotations
will be found to be but few in number, and, with some exceptions in the
early part of the volume, to throw very little light on the obscurities
of the text. A&nbsp;fifth edition of this translation was published so
recently as 1822, but without any improvement, beyond the furbishing up
of the old-fashioned language of the original preface. A&nbsp;far more
literal translation of the Metamorphoses is that by John Clarke, which
was first published about the year 1735, and had attained to a seventh
edition in 1779. Although this version may be pronounced very nearly to
fulfil the promise set forth in its title page, of being “as literal as
possible,” still, from the singular inelegance of its style, and the
fact of its being couched in the conversational language of the early
part of the last century, and being unaccompanied by any attempt at
explanation, it may safely be pronounced to be ill adapted to the
requirements of the present age. Indeed, it would not, perhaps, be too
much to assert, that, although the translator may, in his own words,
“have done an acceptable service to such gentlemen as are desirous of
regaining or improving the skill they acquired at school,” he has, in
many instances, burlesqued rather than translated his author. Some of
the curiosities of his version will be found set forth in the notes;
but, for the purpose of the more readily justifying this assertion,
a&nbsp;few of them are adduced: the word “nitidus” is always rendered
“neat,” whether applied to a fish, a&nbsp;cow, a&nbsp;chariot,
a&nbsp;laurel, the steps of a temple, or the art of wrestling. He
renders “horridus,” “in a rude pickle;” “virgo” is generally translated
“the young lady;” “vir” is “a&nbsp;gentleman;” “senex” and “senior” are
indifferently “the old blade,” “the old fellow,”
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
or “the old gentleman;” while “summa arx” is “the very tip-top.”
“Misera” is “poor soul;” “exsilio” means “to bounce forth;” “pellex” is
“a&nbsp;miss;” “lumina” are “the peepers;” “turbatum fugere” is “to
scower off in a mighty bustle;” “confundor” is “to be jumbled;” and
“squalidus” is “in a sorry pickle.” “Importuna” is “a&nbsp;plaguy
baggage;” “adulterium” is rendered “her pranks;” “ambages” becomes
either “a&nbsp;long rabble of words,” “a&nbsp;long-winded detail,” or
“a&nbsp;tale of a tub;” “miserabile carmen” is “a&nbsp;dismal ditty;”
“increpare hos” is “to rattle these blades;” “penetralia” means “the
parlour;” while “accingere,” more literally than elegantly, is
translated “buckle to.” “Situs” is “nasty stuff;” “oscula jungere” is
“to tip him a kiss;” “pingue ingenium” is a circumlocution for
“a&nbsp;blockhead;” “anilia instrumenta” are “his old woman’s
accoutrements;” and “repetito munere Bacchi” is conveyed to the sense of
the reader as, “they return again to their bottle, and take the other
glass.” These are but a specimen of the blemishes which disfigure the
most literal of the English translations of the Metamorphoses.</p>

<p class = "mynote">
The Clarke “translation” was published as part of a student edition
of Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, with the Latin on the top half of the
page, the English below. It was not intended as an independent
text.</p>

<p>In the year 1656, a little volume was published, by J[ohn]
B[ulloker,] entitled “Ovid’s Metamorphosis, translated grammatically,
and, according to the propriety of our English tongue, so far as grammar
and the verse will bear, written chiefly for the use of schools, to be
used according to the directions in the preface to the painfull
schoolmaster, and more fully in the book called, ‘Ludus Literarius, or
the Grammar school, chap. 8.’” Notwithstanding a title so pretentious,
it contains a translation of no more than the first 567 lines of the
first Book, executed in a fanciful and pedantic manner; and its rarity
is now the only merit of the volume. A&nbsp;literal interlinear
translation of the first Book “on the plan recommended by Mr. Locke,”
was published in 1839, which had been already preceded by
“a&nbsp;selection from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, adapted to the
Hamiltonian system, by a literal and interlineal translation,” published
by James Hamilton, the author of the Hamiltonian system. This work
contains selections only from the first six books, and consequently
embraces but a very small portion of the entire work.</p>

<p>For the better elucidation of the different fabulous narratives and
allusions, explanations have been added, which
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
are principally derived from the writings of Herodotus, Apollodorus,
Pausanias, Dio Cassius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Hyginus,
Nonnus, and others of the historians, philosophers, and mythologists of
antiquity. A&nbsp;great number of these illustrations are collected in
the elaborate edition of Ovid, published by the Abbé Banier, one of the
most learned scholars of the last century; who has, therein, and in his
“Explanations of the Fables of Antiquity,” with indefatigable labour and
research, culled from the works of ancient authors, all such information
as he considered likely to throw any light upon the Mythology and
history of Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>This course has been adopted, because it was considered that a
statement of the opinions of contemporary authors would be the most
likely to enable the reader to form his own ideas upon the various
subjects presented to his notice. Indeed, except in two or three
instances, space has been found too limited to allow of more than an
occasional reference to the opinions of modern scholars. Such being the
object of the explanations, the reader will not be surprised at the
absence of critical and lengthened discussions on many of those moot
points of Mythology and early history which have occupied, with no very
positive result, the attention of Niebuhr, Lobeck, Müller, Buttmann, and
many other scholars of profound learning.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">In</span> the mean time Minos besieges
Megara. Scylla, becoming enamoured of him, betrays her country, the
safety of which depends upon the purple lock of her father Nisu. Being
afterwards rejected by Minos, she clings to his ship, and is changed
into a bird, while her father becomes a sea eagle. Minos returns to
Crete, and having erected the Labyrinth with the assistance of Dædalus,
he there encloses the Minotaur, the disgrace of his family, and feeds it
with his Athenian captives. Theseus being one of these, slays the
monster: and having escaped from the Labyrinth by the aid of Ariadne, he
takes her with him, but deserts her in the isle of Dia, where Bacchus
meets with her, and places her crown among the Constellations. Dædalus
being unable to escape from the island of Crete, invents wings and flies
away; while Icarus, accompanying his father, is drowned. The partridge
beholds the father celebrating his funeral rites, and testifies his joy:
Perdix, or Talus, who had been envied by Minos for his ingenuity, and
had been thrown by him from the temple of Minerva, having been
transformed into that bird. Theseus, having now become celebrated, is
invited to the chase of the Calydonian boar, which Atalanta is the first
to wound. Meleager slays the monster; and his death is accelerated by
his mother Althæa, who places in the fire the fatal billet. Returning
from the expedition, Theseus comes to Acheloüs, and sees the islands
called the Echinades, into which the Naiads have been transformed.
Pirithoüs denies the possibility of this; but Lelex quotes, as an
example, the case of Baucis and Philemon, who were changed into trees,
while their house became a temple, and the neighbouring country a pool
of water. Acheloüs then tells the story of the transformations of
Proteus and of Metra,
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
and how Metra supported her father Erisicthon, while afflicted with
violent hunger.</p>


<h5><a name = "bell_synopsis_IX" id = "bell_synopsis_IX">

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Acheloüs</span> then relates his own
transformations, when he was contending with Hercules for the hand of
Deïanira. Hercules wins her, and Nessus attempts to carry her off: on
which Hercules pierces him with one of his arrows that has been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra. In revenge, Nessus, as he is dying, gives to
Deïanira his garment stained with his blood. She, distrusting her
husband’s affection, sends him the garment; he puts it on, and his
vitals are consumed by the venom. As he is dying, he hurls his attendant
Lychas into the sea, where he becomes a rock. Hercules is conveyed to
heaven, and is enrolled in the number of the Deities. Alcmena, his
mother, goes to her daughter-in-law Iole, and tells her how Galanthis
was changed into a weasel; while she, in her turn, tells the story of
the transformation of her sister Dryope into the lotus. In the meantime
Iolaüs comes, whose youth has been restored by Hebe. Jupiter shows, by
the example of his sons Æacus and Minos, that all are not so blessed.
Miletus, flying from Minos, arrives in Asia, and becomes the father of
Byblis and Caunus. Byblis falls in love with her brother, and is
transformed into a fountain. This would have appeared more surprising to
all, if Iphis had not a short time before, on the day of her nuptials,
been changed into a man.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Hymenæus</span> attends these nuptials, and
then goes to those of Orpheus; but with a bad omen, as Eurydice dies
soon after, and cannot be brought to life. In his sorrow, Orpheus
repairs to the solitudes of the mountains, where the trees flock around
him at the sound of his lyre; and, among others, the pine, into which
Atys has been changed; and the cypress, produced from the transformation
of Cyparissus. Orpheus sings of the rape of Ganymede; of the change of
Hyacinthus, who was beloved and slain by Apollo, into a flower; of the
transformation of the Cerastæ into bulls; of the Propœtides, who were
changed into stones; and of the statue of Pygmalion, which was changed
into a living woman, who became the mother of Paphos. He then sings, how
Myrrha, for her incestuous intercourse with her father, was changed into
the myrrh tree; and how Adonis (to whom Venus relates the transformation
of Hippomenes and Atalanta into lions) was transformed into an
anemone.</p>

women are transformed into trees by Bacchus, who deserts Thrace, and
betakes himself to Phrygia; where Midas, for his care of Silenus,
receives the power of making gold. He loathes this gift; and bathing in
the river Pactolus, its sands become golden. For his stupidity, his ears
are changed by Apollo into those of an ass. After this, that God goes to
Troy, and aids Laomedon in building its walls. Hercules rescues his
daughter Hesione, when fastened to a rock, and his companion Telamon
receives her as his wife; while his brother Peleus marries the sea
Goddess, Thetis. Going to visit Ceyx, he learns how Dædalion has been
changed into a hawk, and sees a wolf changed into a rock. Ceyx goes to
consult the oracle of Claros, and perishes by shipwreck. On this,
Morpheus appears to Halcyone, in the form of her husband, and she is
changed into a kingfisher; into which bird Ceyx is also transformed.
Persons who observe them, as they fly, call to mind how Æsacus, the son
of Priam, was changed into a sea bird, called the didapper.</p>

exception of Paris, who, having gone to Greece, carries off Helen, the
wife of Menelaüs. The Greeks pursue Paris, but are detained at Aulis,
where they see a serpent changed into stone, and prepare to sacrifice
Iphigenia to Diana; but a hind is substituted for her. The Trojans
hearing of the approach of the Greeks, in arms await their arrival. At
the first onset, Cygnus, dashed by Achilles against a stone, is changed
by Neptune into the swan, a&nbsp;bird of the same name, he having been
vulnerable by no weapon. At the banquet of the chiefs, Nestor calls to
mind Cæneus, who was also invulnerable; and who having been changed from
a woman into a man, on being buried under a heap of trees, was
transformed into a bird. This Cæneus was one of the Lapithæ, at the
battle of whom with the Centaurs, Nestor was present. Nestor also tells
how his brother, Periclymenus, was changed into an eagle. Meanwhile,
Neptune laments the death of Cygnus, and entreats Apollo to direct the
arrow of Paris against the heel of Achilles, which is done, and that
hero is slain.</p>

flying from Troy, visits Anius, whose daughters have been changed into

Æneas arrives in Africa, and is entertained by Dido. Passing by the
islands called Pithecusæ, where the Cecropes have been transformed from
men into apes, he comes to Italy; and landing near the spot which he
calls Caicta, he learns from Macareus many particulars respecting
Ulysses and the incantations of Circe, and how king Picus was changed
into a woodpecker. He afterwards wages war with Turnus. Through Venulus,
Turnus asks assistance of Diomedes, whose companions have been
transformed into birds, and he is refused. Venulus, as he returns, sees
the spot where an Apulian shepherd had been changed into an olive tree.
The ships of Æneas, when on fire, become sea Nymphs, just as a heron
formerly arose from the flames of the city of Ardea. Æneas is now made a
Deity. Other kings succeed him, and in the time of Procas Pomona lives.
She is beloved by Vertumnus, who first assumes the form of an old woman;
and having told the story of Anaxarete, who was changed into a stone for
her cruelty, he reassumes the shape of a youth, and prevails upon the

Pythagoras, on the changes which all matter is eternally undergoing.
Egeria laments the death of Numa, and will not listen to the
consolations of Hippolytus, who tells her of his own transformation, and
she pines away into a fountain. This is not less wonderful, than how
Tages sprang from a clod of earth; or how the lance of Romulus became a
tree; or how Cippus became decked with horns. The Poet concludes by
passing to recent events; and after shewing how Æsculapius was first
worshipped by the Romans, in the sacred isle of the Tiber, he relates
the Deification of Julius Cæsar and his change into a Star; and
foretells imperishable fame for himself.</p>

More about the text</a></h5>

<p>Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, translated by Henry Thomas Riley
(1816-1878, B.A. 1840, M.A. 1859), was originally published in 1851 as
part of Bohn’s Classical Library. This e-text, covering Books VIII-XV,
is
based on the 1893 George Bell reprint (London, 1893, one volume). The
edition describes itself as “reprinted from the stereotype plates”.
These may have been the original 1851 plates; the <i>Classical
Library</i> was sold to Bell &amp; Daldy, later George Bell.</p>

<h5><a name = "lines" id = "lines">
Line Numbers</a></h5>

<p>Line numbers from the Latin poem&mdash;not its prose
translation&mdash;were printed as headnotes on each page. In this
e-text, line numbers appear in the left margin, across from the page
numbers. Line numbers used in footnotes are retained from the original
text; these, too, refer to the Latin poem and are independent of line
divisions in the translation.</p>

Errors and Inconsistencies</a></h5>

<p>Typographical errors have been marked with <ins class = "correction"
title = "like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>, with a few exceptions:</p>

<p>Hyphenization is inconsistent&mdash;for example, the forms “sea
monster” and “sea-monster” both occur&mdash;and is not marked unless one
form is clearly anomalous. Errors and omissions in Greek diacritical
marks have been silently corrected.</p>


<h5><a name = "names" id = "names">
Variant Names</a></h5>

<p>This is not intended to be a complete list.</p>

<p>Dieresis is unpredictable; forms such as “Alcathöe” and “Pirithöus”
are common, and have been silently corrected. Since the ligatures “æ”
and “œ” are used consistently, dieresis in “oe” and “ae” can be assumed
even when not explicitly indicated.</p>

<p>Treatment of names in <b>Ia-</b> (pronounced as two syllables) is
inconsistent. <b>Iäsion</b> and <b>Iänthe</b> are regularly written with
dieresis, while <b>Iarbas</b>, <b>Iapyx</b>, <b>Iapygia</b> are written
without.</p>

<p>The forms “Lapithean” and “Lapithæan” both occur.</p>

<p>The “Lilybœus” of Books I-VII is now correctly written “Lilybæus”,
but <b>Erysichthon</b> (with y or upsilon) is written “Erisicthon”.</p>

<p>As in Books I-VII, spellings in “-cth-” (Erisicthon, Erectheus)
are used consistently in place of “-chth-” (-χθ-). Similarly, Phaëthon
is written “Phaëton”.</p>

in the sequence, usually in the form “17*”; some had omissions. In this
e-text, footnotes have been renumbered consecutively within each Book,
without duplication. Simple printing errors, such as missing or
incorrect tags, have been marked where they occur in the text, and are

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
